    "innerHtml": "Are there three or four pleasing poems and are all the rest put in to fill up the book? Nay, verily! The poems in this collection are those that children love. With the exception of seven, they are short enough for children to commit to memory without wearying themselves or losing interest in the poem. If one boy learns \"The Overland Mail,\" or \"The Recruit,\" or \"Wynken, Blynken, and Nod,\" or \"The Song in Camp,\" or \"Old Ironsides,\" or \"I Have a Little Shadow,\" or \"The Tournament,\" or \"The Duel,\" nine boys out of ten will be eager to follow him. I know because I have tried it a dozen times. Every boy loves \"Paul Revere's Ride\" (alas! I have not been able to include it), and is ambitious to learn it, but only boys having a quick memory will persevere to the end. Shall the slower boy be deprived of the pleasure of reading the whole poem and getting its inspiring sentiment and learning as many stanzas as his mind will take? No, indeed. Half of such a poem is better than none. Let the slow boy learn and recite as many stanzas as he can and the boy of quick memory follow him up with the rest. It does not help the slow boy's memory to keep it down entirely or deprive it of its smaller activity because he cannot learn the whole. Some people will invariably give the slow child a very short poem. It is often better to divide a long poem among the children, letting each child learn a part. The sustained interest of a long poem is worth while. \"The Merman,\" \"The Battle of Ivry,\" \"Horatius at the Bridge,\" \"Krinken,\" \"The Skeleton in Armour,\" \"The Raven\" and \"Hervé Riel\" may all profitably be learned that way. Nevertheless, the child enjoys most the poem that is just long enough, and there is much to be said in favour of the selection that is adapted, in length, to the average mind; for the child hesitates in the presence of quantity rather than in the presence of subtle thought. I make claim for this collection that it is made up of poems that the majority of children will learn of their own free will. There are people who believe that in the matter of learning poetry there is no \"<em>ought</em>,\" but this is a false belief. There is a <em>duty</em>, even there; for every American citizen <em>ought</em> to know the great national songs that keep alive the spirit of patriotism. Children should build for their future—and get, while they are children, what only the fresh imagination of the child can assimilate."

There were boys who scrambled for the right to recite \"The Tournament,\" \"The Charge of the Light Brigade,\" \"The Star-Spangled Banner,\" and so on. The boy who was first to reach the front had the privilege. The triumph of getting the chance to recite added to the zest of it. Will they ever forget it?"

March on!\" he said.  \n\nAll day long through Frederick street  \nSounded the tread of marching feet:  \n\nAll day long that free flag tost  \nOver the heads of the rebel host.  \n\nEven its torn folds rose and fell  \nOn the loyal winds that loved it well;  \n\nAnd through the hill-gaps sunset light  \nShone over it with a warm good-night.  \n\nBarbara Frietchie's work is o'er,  \nAnd the rebel rides on his raids no more.  \n\nHonour to her! and let a tear  \nFall, for her sake, on Stonewall's bier.  \n\nOver Barbara Frietchie's grave,  \nFlag of Freedom and Union, wave!  \n\nPeace and order and beauty draw  \nRound thy symbol of light and law;  \n\nAnd ever the stars above look down  \nOn thy stars below in Frederick town!</code>"

I hear the church-bells ring,  \nO say, what may it be?\"  \n\"Tis a fog-bell on a rock-bound coast!\"—  \nAnd he steered for the open sea.  \n\n\"O father! I hear the sound of guns,  \nO say, what may it be?\"  \n\"Some ship in distress, that cannot live  \nIn such an angry sea!\"  \n\n\"O father! I see a gleaming light,  \nO say, what may it be?\"  \nBut the father answered never a word,  \nA frozen corpse was he.  \n\nLashed to the helm, all stiff and stark,  \nWith his face turned to the skies,  \nThe lantern gleamed through the gleaming snow  \nOn his fixed and glassy eyes.  \n\nThen the maiden clasped her hands and prayed  \nThat savèd she might be;  \nAnd she thought of Christ, who stilled the wave  \nOn the Lake of Galilee.  \n\nAnd fast through the midnight dark and drear,  \nThrough the whistling sleet and snow,  \nLike a sheeted ghost the vessel swept  \nToward the reef of Norman's Woe.  \n\nAnd ever the fitful gusts between  \nA sound came from the land;  \nIt was the sound of the trampling surf  \nOn the rocks and the hard sea-sand.  \n\nThe breakers were right beneath her bows,  \nShe drifted a dreary wreck,  \nAnd a whooping billow swept the crew  \nLike icicles from her deck.  \n\nShe struck where the white and fleecy waves  \nLooked soft as carded wool,  \nBut the cruel rocks they gored her side  \nLike the horns of an angry bull.  \n\nHer rattling shrouds all sheathed in ice,  \nWith the masts went by the board;  \nLike a vessel of glass she stove and sank,—  \nHo! ho! the breakers roared!  \n\nAt daybreak on the bleak sea-beach  \nA fisherman stood aghast,  \nTo see the form of a maiden fair  \nLashed close to a drifting mast.  \n\nThe salt sea was frozen on her breast,  \nThe salt tears in her eyes;  \nAnd he saw her hair, like the brown sea-weed,  \nOn the billows fall and rise.  \n\nSuch was the wreck of the _Hesperus_,  \nIn the midnight and the snow!  \nChrist save us all from a death like this,  \nOn the reef of Norman's Woe!  </code>"

They shall have it now;  \nOut cutlasses and board!\"  \n\nIt was our war-ship _Clampherdown_,  \nSpewed up four hundred men;  \nAnd the scalded stokers yelped delight,  \nAs they rolled in the waist and heard the fight,  \nStamp o'er their steel-walled pen.  \n\nThey cleared the cruiser end to end,  \nFrom conning-tower to hold.  \nThey fought as they fought in Nelson's fleet;  \nThey were stripped to the waist, they were bare to the feet,  \nAs it was in the days of old.  \n\nIt was the sinking _Clampherdown_  \nHeaved up her battered side—  \nAnd carried a million pounds in steel,  \nTo the cod and the corpse-fed conger-eel,  \nAnd the scour of the Channel tide.  \n\nIt was the crew of the _Clampherdown_  \nStood out to sweep the sea,  \nOn a cruiser won from an ancient foe,  \nAs it was in the days of long-ago,  \nAnd as it still shall be.  </code>"

Hurrah! a single field hath turned the chance of war,  \nHurrah! Hurrah! for Ivry, and Henry of Navarre.  \n\nOh! how our hearts were beating, when, at the dawn of day,  \nWe saw the army of the League drawn out in long array;  \nWith all its priest-led citizens, and all its rebel peers,  \nAnd Appenzel's stout infantry, and Egmont's Flemish spears.  \nThere rode the brood of false Lorraine, the curses of our land;  \nAnd dark Mayenne was in the midst, a truncheon in his hand;  \nAnd, as we looked on them, we thought of Seine's empurpled flood,  \nAnd good Coligni's hoary hair all dabbled with his blood;  \nAnd we cried unto the living God, who rules the fate of war,  \nTo fight for His own holy name, and Henry of Navarre.  \n\nThe King is come to marshal us, in all his armour drest,  \nAnd he has bound a snow-white plume upon his gallant crest.  \nHe looked upon his people, and a tear was in his eye;  \nHe looked upon the traitors, and his glance was stern and high.  \nRight graciously he smiled on us, as rolled from wing to wing,  \nDown all our line, a deafening shout, \"God save our Lord the King!\"  \n\"And if my standard-bearer fall, as fall full well he may,  \nFor never saw I promise yet of such a bloody fray,  \nPress where ye see my white plume shine, amid the ranks of war,  \nAnd be your oriflamme to-day the helmet of Navarre.\"  \n\nHurrah! the foes are moving. Hark to the mingled din  \nOf fife, and steed, and trump, and drum, and roaring culverin.  \nThe fiery Duke is pricking fast across St. André's plain,  \nWith all the hireling chivalry of Guelders and Almayne.  \nNow by the lips of those ye love, fair gentlemen of France,  \nCharge for the golden lilies,—upon them with the lance.  \nA thousand spurs are striking deep, a thousand spears in rest,  \nA thousand knights are pressing close behind the snow-white crest;  \nAnd in they burst, and on they rushed, while like a guiding star,  \nAmid the thickest carnage blazed the helmet of Navarre.  \n\nNow, God be praised, the day is ours. Mayenne hath turned his rein.  \nD'Aumale hath cried for quarter. The Flemish count is slain.  \nTheir ranks are breaking like thin clouds before a Biscay gale;  \nThe field is heaped with bleeding steeds, and flags, and cloven mail.  \nAnd then we thought on vengeance, and, all along our van,  \n\"Remember St. Bartholomew!\" was passed from man to man.  \nBut out spake gentle Henry, \"No Frenchman is my foe:  \nDown, down with every foreigner, but let your brethren go.\"  \nOh! was there ever such a knight, in friendship or in war,  \nAs our Sovereign Lord, King Henry, the soldier of Navarre?  \n\nRight well fought all the Frenchmen who fought for France to-day;  \nAnd many a lordly banner God gave them for a prey.  \nBut we of the Religion have borne us best in fight;  \nAnd the good lord of Rosny has ta'en the cornet white.  \nOur own true Maximilian the cornet white hath ta'en,  \nThe cornet white with crosses black, the flag of false Lorraine.  \nUp with it high; unfurl it wide; that all the host may know  \nHow God hath humbled the proud house which wrought His church such woe.  \nThen on the ground, while trumpets sound their loudest points of war,  \nFling the red shreds, a footcloth meet for Henry of Navarre.  \n\nHo! maidens of Vienna; Ho! matrons of Lucerne;  \nWeep, weep, and rend your hair for those who never shall return.  \nHo! Philip, send, for charity, thy Mexican pistoles,  \nThat Antwerp monks may sing a mass for thy poor spearman's souls.  \nHo! gallant nobles of the League, look that your arms be bright;  \nHo! burghers of Saint Genevieve, keep watch and ward to-night.  \nFor our God hath crushed the tyrant, our God hath raised the slave,  \nAnd mocked the counsel of the wise, the valour of the brave.  \nThen glory to His holy name, from whom all glories are;  \nAnd glory to our Sovereign Lord, King Henry of Navarre.  </code>"

Sir Consul;  \nLars Porsena is here.\"  \nOn the low hills to westward  \nThe Consul fixed his eye,  \nAnd saw the swarthy storm of dust  \nRise fast along the sky.  \n\nAnd nearer, fast, and nearer  \nDoth the red whirlwind come;  \nAnd louder still, and still more loud,  \nFrom underneath that rolling cloud,  \nIs heard the trumpet's war-note proud,  \nThe trampling and the hum.  \nAnd plainly and more plainly  \nNow through the gloom appears,  \nFar to left and far to right,  \nIn broken gleams of dark-blue light,  \nThe long array of helmets bright,  \nThe long array of spears.  \n\nAnd plainly and more plainly,  \nAbove the glimmering line,  \nNow might ye see the banners  \nOf twelve fair cities shine;  \nBut the banner of proud Clusium  \nWas the highest of them all,  \nThe terror of the Umbrian,  \nThe terror of the Gaul.  \n\nFast by the royal standard,  \nO'erlooking all the war,  \nLars Porsena of Clusium  \nSat in his ivory car.  \nBy the right wheel rode Mamilius,  \nPrince of the Latian name,  \nAnd by the left false Sextus,  \nThat wrought the deed of shame.  \n\nBut when the face of Sextus  \nWas seen among the foes,  \nA yell that rent the firmament  \nFrom all the town arose.  \nOn the house-tops was no woman  \nBut spat toward him and hissed,  \nNo child but screamed out curses,  \nAnd shook its little fist.  \n\nBut the Consul's brow was sad,  \nAnd the Consul's speech was low,  \nAnd darkly looked he at the wall,  \nAnd darkly at the foe.  \n\"Their van will be upon us  \nBefore the bridge goes down;  \nAnd if they once may win the bridge,  \nWhat hope to save the town?\"  \n\nThen out spake brave Horatius,  \nThe Captain of the Gate:  \n\"To every man upon this earth  \nDeath cometh soon or late;  \nAnd how can man die better  \nThan facing fearful odds,  \nFor the ashes of his fathers,  \nAnd the temples of his gods.  \n\n\"And for the tender mother  \nWho dandled him to rest,  \nAnd for the wife who nurses  \nHis baby at her breast,  \nAnd for the holy maidens  \nWho feed the eternal flame,  \nTo save them from false Sextus  \nThat wrought the deed of shame?  \n\n\"Hew down the bridge, Sir Consul,  \nWith all the speed ye may;  \nI, with two more to help me,  \nWill hold the foe in play.  \nIn yon straight path a thousand  \nMay well be stopped by three.  \nNow who will stand on either hand,  \nAnd keep the bridge with me?\"  \n\nThen out spake Spurius Lartius—  \nA Ramnian proud was he—  \nI will stand at thy right hand,  \nAnd keep the bridge with thee.\"  \nAnd out spake strong Herminius—  \nOf Titian blood was he—  \n\"I will abide on thy left side,  \nAnd keep the bridge with thee.\"  \n\n\"Horatius,\" quoth the Consul,  \n\"As thou say'st, so let it be,\"  \nAnd straight against that great array  \nForth went the dauntless Three.  \nFor Romans in Rome's quarrel  \nSpared neither land nor gold,  \nNor son nor wife, nor limb nor life,  \nIn the brave days of old.  \n\nNow while the Three were tightening  \nTheir harness on their backs,  \nThe Consul was the foremost man  \nTo take in hand an ax;  \nAnd Fathers mixed with Commons  \nSeized hatchet, bar, and crow,  \nAnd smote upon the planks above,  \nAnd loosed the props below.  \nMeanwhile the Tuscan army,  \nRight glorious to behold,  \nCame flashing back the noonday light,  \nRank behind rank, like surges bright  \nOf a broad sea of gold.  \n\nFour hundred trumpets sounded  \nA peal of warlike glee,  \nAs that great host, with measured tread,  \nAnd spears advanced, and ensigns spread,  \nRolled slowly toward the bridge's head,  \nWhere stood the dauntless Three.  \n\nThe Three stood calm and silent,  \nAnd looked upon the foes,  \nAnd a great shout of laughter  \nFrom all the vanguard rose:  \nAnd forth three chiefs came spurring  \nBefore that deep array;  \nTo earth they sprang, their swords they drew,  \nAnd lifted high their shields, and flew  \nTo win the narrow way;  \n\nAunus from green Tifernum,  \nLord of the Hill of Vines;  \nAnd Seius, whose eight hundred slaves  \nSicken in Ilva's mines;  \nAnd Picus, long to Clusium  \nVassal in peace and war,  \nWho led to fight his Umbrian powers  \nFrom that gray crag where, girt with towers,  \nThe fortress of Nequinum lowers  \nO'er the pale waves of Nar.  \n\nStout Lartius hurled down Aunus  \nInto the stream beneath;  \nHerminius struck at Seius,  \nAnd clove him to the teeth;  \nAt Picus brave Horatius  \nDarted one fiery thrust;  \nAnd the proud Umbrian's gilded arms  \nClashed in the bloody dust.  \n\nThen Ocnus of Falerii  \nRushed on the Roman Three;  \nAnd Lausulus of Urgo,  \nThe rover of the sea;  \nAnd Aruns of Volsinium,  \nWho slew the great wild boar,  \nThe great wild boar that had his den  \nAmid the reeds of Cosa's fen.  \nAnd wasted fields and slaughtered men  \nAlong Albinia's shore.  \n\nHerminius smote down Aruns;  \nLartius laid Ocnus low;  \nRight to the heart of Lausulus  \nHoratius sent a blow.  \n\"Lie there,\" he cried, \"fell pirate!  \nNo more, aghast and pale,  \nFrom Ostia's walls the crowd shall mark  \nThe tracks of thy destroying bark,  \nNo more Campania's hinds shall fly  \nTo woods and caverns when they spy  \nThy thrice accurséd sail.\"  \n\nBut now no sound of laughter  \nWas heard among the foes.  \nA wild and wrathful clamour  \nFrom all the vanguard rose.  \nSix spears' length from the entrance  \nHalted that deep array,  \nAnd for a space no man came forth  \nTo win the narrow way.  \n\nBut hark! the cry is Astur:  \nAnd lo! the ranks divide;  \nAnd the great Lord of Luna  \nComes with his stately stride.  \nUpon his ample shoulders  \nClangs loud the fourfold shield,  \nAnd in his hand he shakes the brand  \nWhich none but he can wield.  \n\nHe smiled on those bold Romans,  \nA smile serene and high;  \nHe eyed the flinching Tuscans,  \nAnd scorn was in his eye.  \nQuoth he: \"The she-wolf's litter  \nStand savagely at bay;  \nBut will ye dare to follow,  \nIf Astur clears the way?\"  \n\nThen, whirling up his broadsword  \nWith both hands to the height,  \nHe rushed against Horatius,  \nAnd smote with all his might.  \nWith shield and blade Horatius  \nRight deftly turned the blow.  \nThe blow, though turned, came yet too nigh;  \nIt missed his helm, but gashed his thigh:  \nThe Tuscans raised a joyful cry  \nTo see the red blood flow.  \n\nHe reeled, and on Herminius  \nHe leaned one breathing space;  \nThen, like a wildcat mad with wounds,  \nSprang right at Astur's face.  \nThrough teeth, and skull, and helmet,  \nSo fierce a thrust he sped,  \nThe good sword stood a handbreadth out  \nBehind the Tuscan's head.  \n\nAnd the great Lord of Luna  \nFell at the deadly stroke,  \nAs falls on Mount Alvernus  \nA thunder-smitten oak.  \nFar o'er the crashing forest  \nThe giant arms lie spread;  \nAnd the pale augurs, muttering low,  \nGaze on the blasted head.  \n\nOn Astur's throat Horatius  \nRight firmly pressed his heel,  \nAnd thrice and four times tugged amain  \nEre he wrenched out the steel.  \n\"And see,\" he cried, \"the welcome,  \nFair guests, that waits you here!  \nWhat noble Lucumo comes next  \nTo taste our Roman cheer?\"  \n\nBut at his haughty challenge  \nA sullen murmur ran,  \nMingled of wrath, and shame, and dread,  \nAlong that glittering van.  \nThere lacked not men of prowess,  \nNor men of lordly race;  \nFor all Etruria's noblest  \nWere round the fatal place.  \n\nBut all Etruria's noblest  \nFelt their hearts sink to see  \nOn the earth the bloody corpses,  \nIn the path the dauntless Three:  \nAnd, from the ghastly entrance  \nWhere those bold Romans stood,  \nAll shrank, like boys who unaware,  \nRanging the woods to start a hare,  \nCome to the mouth of the dark lair  \nWhere, growling low, a fierce old bear  \nLies amid bones and blood.  \n\nWas none who would be foremost  \nTo lead such dire attack?  \nBut those behind cried \"Forward!\"  \nAnd those before cried \"Back!\"  \nAnd backward now and forward  \nWavers the deep array;  \nAnd on the tossing sea of steel  \nTo and fro the standards reel;  \nAnd the victorious trumpet peal  \nDies fitfully away.  \n\nYet one man for one moment  \nStrode out before the crowd;  \nWell known was he to all the Three,  \nAnd they gave him greeting loud:  \n\"Now welcome, welcome, Sextus!  \nNow welcome to thy home!  \nWhy dost thou stay, and turn away?  \nHere lies the road to Rome.\"  \n\nThrice looked he at the city;  \nThrice looked he at the dead;  \nAnd thrice came on in fury,  \nAnd thrice turned back in dread:  \nAnd, white with fear and hatred,  \nScowled at the narrow way  \nWhere, wallowing in a pool of blood,  \nThe bravest Tuscans lay.  \n\nBut meanwhile ax and lever  \nHave manfully been plied,  \nAnd now the bridge hangs tottering  \nAbove the boiling tide.  \n\"Come back, come back, Horatius!\"  \nLoud cried the Fathers all.  \n\"Back, Lartius! Back, Herminius!  \nBack, ere the ruin fall!\"  \n\nBack darted Spurius Lartius;  \nHerminius darted back:  \nAnd, as they passed, beneath their feet  \nThey felt the timbers crack.  \nBut when they turned their faces,  \nAnd on the farther shore  \nSaw brave Horatius stand alone,  \nThey would have crossed once more.  \n\nBut with a crash like thunder  \nFell every loosened beam,  \nAnd, like a dam, the mighty wreck  \nLay right athwart the stream;  \nAnd a long shout of triumph  \nRose from the walls of Rome,  \nAs to the highest turret tops  \nWas splashed the yellow foam.  \n\nAnd, like a horse unbroken  \nWhen first he feels the rein,  \nThe furious river struggled hard,  \nAnd tossed his tawny mane;  \nAnd burst the curb, and bounded,  \nRejoicing to be free,  \nAnd whirling down, in fierce career,  \nBattlement, and plank, and pier,  \nRushed headlong to the sea.  \n\nAlone stood brave Horatius,  \nBut constant still in mind;  \nThrice thirty thousand foes before,  \nAnd the broad flood behind.  \n\"Down with him!\" cried false Sextus,  \nWith a smile on his pale face.  \n\"Now yield thee,\" cried Lars Porsena,  \n\"Now yield thee to our grace.\"  \n\nRound turned he, as not deigning  \nThose craven ranks to see;  \nNaught spake he to Lars Porsena,  \nTo Sextus naught spake he;  \nBut he saw on Palatinus  \nThe white porch of his home;  \nAnd he spake to the noble river  \nThat rolls by the towers of Rome:  \n\n\"O Tiber! Father Tiber!  \nTo whom the Romans pray,  \nA Roman's life, a Roman's arms,  \nTake thou in charge this day!\"  \nSo he spake, and speaking sheathed  \nThe good sword by his side,  \nAnd, with his harness on his back,  \nPlunged headlong in the tide.  \n\nNo sound of joy or sorrow  \nWas heard from either bank;  \nBut friends and foes in dumb surprise,  \nWith parted lips and straining eyes,  \nStood gazing where he sank;  \nAnd when above the surges  \nThey saw his crest appear,  \nAll Rome sent forth a rapturous cry,  \nAnd even the ranks of Tuscany  \nCould scarce forbear to cheer.  \n\nAnd fiercely ran the current,  \nSwollen high by months of rain;  \nAnd fast his blood was flowing,  \nAnd he was sore in pain,  \nAnd heavy with his armour,  \nAnd spent with changing blows:  \nAnd oft they thought him sinking,  \nBut still again he rose.  \n\nNever, I ween, did swimmer,  \nIn such an evil case,  \nStruggle through such a raging flood  \nSafe to the landing place;  \nBut his limbs were borne up bravely  \nBy the brave heart within,  \nAnd our good Father Tiber  \nBore bravely up his chin.  \n\n\"Curse on him!\" quoth false Sextus;  \n\"Will not the villain drown?  \nBut for this stay, ere close of day  \nWe should have sacked the town!\"  \n\"Heaven help him!\" quoth Lars Porsena,  \n\"And bring him safe to shore;  \nFor such a gallant feat of arms  \nWas never seen before.\"  \n\nAnd now he feels the bottom;  \nNow on dry earth he stands;  \nNow round him throng the Fathers  \nTo press his gory hands;  \nAnd now with shouts and clapping,  \nAnd noise of weeping loud,  \nHe enters through the River Gate,  \nBorne by the joyous crowd.  \n\nThey gave him of the corn land,  \nThat was of public right.  \nAs much as two strong oxen  \nCould plow from morn till night:  \nAnd they made a molten image,  \nAnd set it up on high,  \nAnd there it stands unto this day  \nTo witness if I lie.  \n\nIt stands in the Comitium,  \nPlain for all folk to see,—  \nHoratius in his harness,  \nHalting upon one knee:  \nAnd underneath is written,  \nIn letters all of gold,  \nHow valiantly he kept the bridge  \nIn the brave days of old.  \n\nAnd still his name sounds stirring  \nUnto the men of Rome,  \nAs the trumpet blast that cries to them  \nTo charge the Volscian home;  \nAnd wives still pray to Juno  \nFor boys with hearts as bold  \nAs his who kept the bridge so well  \nIn the brave days of old.  \n\nAnd in the nights of winter,  \nWhen the cold north winds blow,  \nAnd the long howling of the wolves  \nIs heard amid the snow;  \nWhen round the lonely cottage  \nRoars loud the tempest's din,  \nAnd the good logs of Algidus  \nRoar louder yet within;  \n\nWhen the oldest cask is opened,  \nAnd the largest lamp is lit;  \nWhen the chestnuts glow in the embers,  \nAnd the kid turns on the spit;  \nWhen young and old in circle  \nAround the firebrands close;  \nWhen the girls are weaving baskets,  \nAnd the lads are shaping bows;  \n\nWhen the goodman mends his armour,  \nAnd trims his helmet's plume;  \nWhen the goodwife's shuttle merrily  \nGoes flashing through the loom,—  \nWith weeping and with laughter  \nStill is the story told,  \nHow well Horatius kept the bridge  \nIn the brave days of old. </code>"

I must fly, but follow quick.  \nWe are six ships of the line; can we fight with fifty-three?\"  \n\nThen spake Sir Richard Grenville: \"I know you are no coward;  \nYou fly them for a moment, to fight with them again.  \nBut I've ninety men and more that are lying sick ashore.  \nI should count myself the coward if I left them, my Lord Howard,  \nTo these Inquisition dogs and the devildoms of Spain.\"  \n\nSo Lord Howard passed away with five ships of war that day,  \nTill he melted like a cloud in the silent summer heaven;  \nBut Sir Richard bore in hand all his sick men from the land  \nVery carefully and slow,  \nMen of Bideford in Devon,  \nAnd we laid them on the ballast down below;  \nFor we brought them all aboard,  \nAnd they blest him in their pain that they were not left to Spain,  \nTo the thumbscrew and the stake, for the glory of the Lord.  \n\nHe had only a hundred seamen to work the ship and to fight,  \nAnd he sail'd away from Flores till the Spaniard came in sight,  \nWith his huge sea-castles heaving upon the weather bow.  \n\"Shall we fight or shall we fly?  \nGood Sir Richard, tell us now,  \nFor to fight is but to die!  \n\n\"There'll be little of us left by the time this sun be set\"  \nAnd Sir Richard said again: \"We be all good Englishmen.  \nLet us bang these dogs of Seville, the children of the devil,  \nFor I never turn'd my back upon Don or devil yet.\"  \n\nSir Richard spoke and he laugh'd, and we roar'd a hurrah, and so  \nThe little _Revenge_ ran on sheer into the heart of the foe,  \nWith her hundred fighters on deck, and her ninety sick below;  \nFor half of their fleet to the right and half to the left were seen,  \nAnd the little _Revenge_ ran on thro' the long sea-lane between.  \n\nThousands of their soldiers looked down from their decks and laugh'd,  \nThousands of their seamen made mock at the mad little craft  \nRunning on and on, till delay'd  \nBy their mountain-like _San Philip_ that, of fifteen hundred tons,  \nAnd up-shadowing high above us with her yawning tiers of guns,  \nTook the breath from our sails, and we stay'd.  \n\nAnd while now the great _San Philip_ hung above us like a cloud  \nWhence the thunderbolt will fall  \nLong and loud.  \nFour galleons drew away  \nFrom the Spanish fleet that day,  \nAnd two upon the larboard and two upon the starboard lay,  \nAnd the battle-thunder broke from them all.  \n\nBut anon the great _San Philip_, she bethought herself and went,  \nHaving that within her womb that had left her ill content;  \nAnd the rest they came aboard us, and they fought us hand to hand,  \nFor a dozen times they came with their pikes and musqueteers,  \nAnd a dozen times we shook 'em off as a dog that shakes his ears  \nWhen he leaps from the water to the land.  \n\nAnd the sun went down, and the stars came out far over the summer sea,  \nBut never a moment ceased the fight of the one and the fifty-three;  \nShip after ship, the whole night long, their high-built galleons came,  \nShip after ship, the whole night long, with her battle-thunder and flame;  \nShip after ship, the whole night long, drew back with her dead and her shame.  \nFor some were sunk and many were shatter'd, and so could fight us no more—  \nGod of battles, was ever a battle like this in the world before?  \n\nFor he said, \"Fight on! fight on!\"  \nTho' his vessel was all but a wreck;  \nAnd it chanced that, when half of the short summer night was gone,  \nWith a grisly wound to be drest he had left the deck,  \nBut a bullet struck him that was dressing it suddenly dead,  \nAnd himself he was wounded again in the side and the head,  \nAnd he said, \"Fight on! Fight on!\"  \n\nAnd the night went down, and the sun smiled out far over the summer sea,  \nAnd the Spanish fleet with broken sides lay round us all in a ring;  \nBut they dared not touch us again, for they fear'd that we still could sting,  \nSo they watched what the end would be.  \nAnd we had not fought them in vain,  \nBut in perilous plight were we,  \nSeeing forty of our poor hundred were slain,  \nAnd half of the rest of us maim'd for life  \nIn the crash of the cannonades and the desperate strife;  \nAnd the sick men down in the hold were most of them stark and cold,  \nAnd the pikes were all broken or bent, and the powder was all of it spent;  \nAnd the masts and the rigging were lying over the side;  \nBut Sir Richard cried in his English pride:  \n\"We have fought such a fight for a day and a night  \nAs may never be fought again!  \nWe have won great glory, my men!  \nAnd a day less or more  \nAt sea or ashore,  \nWe die—does it matter when?  \nSink me the ship, Master Gunner—sink her, split her in twain!  \nFall into the hands of God, not into the hands of Spain!\"  \n\nAnd the gunner said. \"Ay, ay,\" but the seamen made reply:  \n\"We have children, we have wives,  \nAnd the Lord hath spared our lives.  \nWe will make the Spaniard promise, if we yield, to let us go;  \nWe shall live to fight again, and to strike another blow.\"  \nAnd the lion there lay dying, and they yielded to the foe.  \nAnd the stately Spanish men to their flagship bore him then,  \nWhere they laid him by the mast, old Sir Richard caught at last,  \nAnd they praised him to his face with their courtly foreign grace;  \nBut he rose upon their decks, and he cried:  \n\"I have fought for Queen and Faith like a valiant man and true;  \nI have only done my duty as a man is bound to do.  \nWith a joyful spirit I, Sir Richard Grenville, die!\"  \nAnd he fell upon their decks, and he died.  \n\nAnd they stared at the dead that had been so valiant and true,  \nAnd had holden the power and glory of Spain so cheap  \nThat he dared her with one little ship and his English few.  \nWas he devil or man? He was devil for aught they knew,  \nBut they sank his body with honour down into the deep,  \nAnd they mann'd the _Revenge_ with a swarthier alien crew,  \nAnd away she sail'd with her loss and long'd for her own;  \nWhen a wind from the lands they had ruin'd awoke from sleep,  \nAnd the water began to heave and the weather to moan,  \nAnd or ever that evening ended a great gale blew,  \nAnd a wave like the wave that is raised by an earthquake grew,  \nTill it smote on their hulls, and their sails, and their masts, and their flags,  \nAnd the whole sea plunged and fell on the shot-shatter'd navy of Spain,  \nAnd the little _Revenge_ herself went down by the island crags,  \nTo be lost evermore in the main. </code>"

Salvation does not come through the faith that builds itself at the expense of love."

This is an enchanted land, and the Scotch people for miles around Ayr speak of the poet with sincere affection.

The poem is full of magnificent lines, such as \"Go, soul, the body's guest.\" The poem never lacks an attentive audience of young people when correlated with the study of North Carolina and Sir Walter Raleigh. The solitary, majestic character of Sir Walter Raleigh, his intrepidity while undergoing tortures inflicted by a cowardly king, the ring of indignation—- all these make a weapon for him stronger than the ax that beheaded him.

distinctly I remember, it was in the bleak December,  \nAnd each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor;  \nEagerly I wished the morrow; vainly I had sought to borrow  \nFrom my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore—  \nFor the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore—  \nNameless here for evermore.  \n\nAnd the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain  \nThrilled me—filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;  \nSo that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating,  \n\"'Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door—  \nSome late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door:  \nThis it is, and nothing more.\"  \n\nPresently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,  \n\"Sir,\" said I, \"or madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;  \nBut the fact is, I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,  \nAnd so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,  \nThat I scarce was sure I heard you.\" Here I opened wide the door:  \nDarkness there, and nothing more.  \n\nDeep into that darkness peering, long I stood there, wondering, fearing,  \nDoubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;  \nBut the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,  \nAnd the only word there spoken was the whispered word, \"Lenore!\"  \nThis I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, \"Lenore!\"  \nMerely this, and nothing more.  \n\nBack into my chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,  \nSoon again I heard a rapping, something louder than before:  \n\"Surely,\" said I, \"surely that is something at my window lattice;  \nLet me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore—  \nLet my heart be still a moment, and this mystery explore.  \n'Tis the wind, and nothing more.\"  \n\nOpen here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,  \nIn there stepped a stately Raven, of the saintly days of yore;  \nNot the least obeisance made he, not a minute stopped or stayed he;  \nBut with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door—  \nPerched above a bust of Pallas, just above my chamber door—  \nPerched, and sat, and nothing more.  \n\nThen this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,  \nBy the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore;  \n\"Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,\" I said, \"art sure, no craven;  \nGhastly, grim, and ancient Raven, wandering from the nightly shore,  \nTell me what thy lordly name is on the night's Plutonian shore?\"  \nQuoth the Raven, \"Nevermore.\"  \n\nMuch I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,  \nThough its answer, little meaning, little relevancy bore;  \nFor we cannot help agreeing that no living human being  \nEver yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door—  \nBird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door  \nWith such a name as \"Nevermore.\"  \n\nBut the Raven, sitting lonely on that placid bust, spoke only  \nThat one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour;  \nNothing further then he uttered, not a feather then he fluttered,  \nTill I scarcely more than muttered—\"Other friends have flown before,  \nOn the morrow he will leave me, as my hopes have flown before.\"  \nThen the bird said, \"Nevermore.\"  \n\nStartled by the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,  \n\"Doubtless,\" said I, \"what it utters is its only stock and store,  \nCaught from some unhappy master, whom unmerciful disaster  \nFollowed fast and followed faster, till his songs one burden bore—  \nTill the dirges of his hope this melancholy burden bore—  \nOf 'Never, nevermore,'\"  \n\nBut the Raven still beguiling all my sad soul into smiling,  \nStraight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust, and door;  \nThen upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking  \nFancy into fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore—  \nWhat this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore  \nMeant in croaking \"Nevermore.\"  \n\nThus I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing  \nTo the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom's core;  \nThis and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining  \nOn the cushion's velvet lining, that the lamp-light gloated o'er,  \nBut whose velvet violet lining, with the lamp-light gloating o'er,  \nShe shall press, ah, nevermore!  \n\nThen methought the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer  \nSwung by seraphim, whose footfalls twinkled on the tufted floor.  \n\"Wretch,\" I cried, \"thy God hath lent thee—by these angels He hath sent thee  \nRespite—respite and nepenthe from my memories of Lenore!  \nQuaff, oh, quaff this kind nepenthe, and forget this lost Lenore!\"  \nQuoth the Raven, \"Nevermore.\"  \n\n\"Prophet,\" said I, \"thing of evil—prophet still, if bird or devil!  \nWhether tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore  \nDesolate, yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted,  \nOn this home by horror haunted—tell me truly, I implore,  \nIs there—_is_ there balm in Gilead?—tell me, tell me, I implore!\"  \nQuoth the Raven, \"Nevermore.\"  \n\n\"Prophet,\" said I, \"thing of evil!—prophet still if bird or devil!  \nBy that heaven that bends above us—by that God we both adore—  \nTell this soul, with sorrow laden, if, within the distant Aiden  \nIt shall clasp a sainted maiden, whom the angels name Lenore!  \nClasp a rare and radiant maiden, whom the angels name Lenore?\"  \nQuoth the Raven, \"Nevermore.\"  \n\n\"Be that our sign of parting, bird or fiend,\" I shrieked, upstarting—  \n\"Get thee back into the tempest and the night's Plutonian shore;  \nLeave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken,  \nLeave my loneliness unbroken—quit the bust above my door,  \nTake thy beak from out my heart and take thy form from off my door!\"  \nQuoth the Raven, \"Nevermore.\"  \n\nAnd the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting,  \nOn the pallid bust of Pallas, just above my chamber door;  \nAnd his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming,  \nAnd the lamp-light o'er him streaming, throws his shadow on the floor;  \nAnd my soul from out that shadow, that lies floating on the floor,  \nShall be lifted—nevermore!

 \nCan Honour's voice provoke the silent dust,  \nOr Flatt'ry soothe the dull cold ear of Death?  \n\nPerhaps in this neglected spot is laid  \nSome heart once pregnant with celestial fire,  \nHands that the rod of empire might have sway'd,  \nOr waked to ecstasy the living lyre.  \n\nBut Knowledge to their eyes her ample page  \nRich with the spoils of time did ne'er unroll;  \nChill Penury repress'd their noble rage,  \nAnd froze the genial current of the soul.  \n\nFull many a gem of purest ray serene,  \nThe dark unfathom'd caves of ocean bear:  \nFull many a flower is born to blush unseen,  \nAnd waste its sweetness on the desert air.  \n\nSome village-Hampden, that with dauntless breast  \nThe little tyrant of his fields withstood;  \nSome mute inglorious Milton here may rest,  \nSome Cromwell guiltless of his country's blood.  \n\nTh' applause of listening senates to command,  \nThe threats of pain and ruin to despise,  \nTo scatter plenty o'er a smiling land,  \nAnd read their history in a nation's eyes,  \n\nTheir lot forbad: nor circumscribed alone  \nTheir growing virtues, but their crimes confined  \nForbad to wade through slaughter to a throne,  \nAnd shut the gates of mercy on mankind,  \n\nThe struggling pangs of conscious truth to hide,  \nTo quench the blushes of ingenuous shame,  \nOr heap the shrine of Luxury and Pride  \nWith incense, kindled at the Muse's flame.  \n\nFar from the madding crowd's ignoble strife,  \nTheir sober wishes never learn'd to stray;  \nAlong the cool sequester'd vale of life  \nThey kept the noiseless tenour of their way.  \n\nYet e'en those bones from insult to protect  \nSome frail memorial still erected nigh,  \nWith uncouth rhimes and shapeless sculpture deck'd,  \nImplores the passing tribute of a sigh.  \n\nTheir name, their years, spelt by th' unlettered Muse,  \nThe place of fame and elegy supply.  \nAnd many a holy text around she strews  \nThat teach the rustic moralist to die.  \n\nFor who to dumb forgetfulness a prey,  \nThis pleasing anxious being e'er resigned,  \nLeft the warm precincts of the cheerful day,  \nNor cast one longing, ling'ring look behind?  \n\nOn some fond breast the parting soul relies,  \nSome pious drops the closing eye requires;  \nE'en from the tomb the voice of Nature cries,  \nE'en in our ashes live their wonted fires.  \n\nFor thee, who, mindful of th' unhonour'd dead,  \nDost in these lines their artless tale relate;  \nIf chance, by lonely Contemplation led,  \nSome kindred spirit shall inquire thy fate,  \n\nHaply some hoary-headed swain may say,  \n\"Oft have we seen him at the peep of dawn  \nBrushing with hasty steps the dews away,  \nTo meet the sun upon the upland lawn.  \n\n\"There at the foot of yonder nodding beech  \nThat wreathes its old fantastic roots so high,  \nHis listless length at noon-tide would he stretch,  \nAnd pore upon the brook that babbles by.  \n\n\"Hard by yon wood, now smiling as in scorn,  \nMuttering his wayward fancies he would rove;  \nNow drooping, woeful wan, like one forlorn,  \nOr crazed with care, or crossed in hopeless love.  \n\n\"One morn I miss'd him on the custom'd hill,  \nAlong the heath, and near his favourite tree;  \nAnother came; nor yet beside the rill,  \nNor up the lawn, nor at the wood was he.  \n\n\"The next with dirges due in sad array  \nSlow thro' the church-way path we saw him borne.  \nApproach and read (for thou canst read the lay,       ) \n\nGraved on the stone beneath yon agèd thorn.\"  </code>"

All that is, at all,  \nLasts ever, past recall;  \nEarth changes, but thy soul and God stand sure;  \nWhat enter'd into thee,  \n_That_ was, is, and shall be:  \nTime's wheel runs back or stops: Potter and clay endure.  \n\nHe fix'd thee 'mid this dance  \nOf plastic circumstance,  \nThis Present, thou, forsooth, wouldst fain arrest  \nMachinery just meant  \nTo give thy soul its bent,  \nTry thee and turn thee forth, sufficiently impress'd.  \n\nWhat though the earlier grooves  \nWhich ran the laughing loves  \nAround thy base, no longer pause and press?  \nWhat though, about thy rim,  \nScull-things in order grim  \nGrow out, in graver mood, obey the sterner stress?  \n\nLook not thou down but up!  \nTo uses of a cup,  \nThe festal board, lamp's flash and trumpet's peal,  \nThe new wine's foaming flow,  \nThe master's lips aglow!  \nThou, heaven's consummate cup, what need'st thou with earth's wheel?  \n\nBut I need, now as then,  \nThee, God, who mouldest men;  \nAnd since, not even while the whirl was worst  \nDid I,—to the wheel of life  \nWith shapes and colours rife,  \nBound dizzily,—mistake my end, to slake Thy thirst:  \n\nSo, take and use Thy work:  \nAmend what flaws may lurk,  \nWhat strain o' the stuff, what warpings past the aim!  \nMy times be in Thy hand!  \nPerfect the cup as plann'd!  \nLest age approve of youth, and death complete the same! </code>"

Rather say,  \nWhile rock stands or water runs,  \nNot a ship will leave the bay!\"  \n\nThen was called a council straight;  \nBrief and bitter the debate:  \n\"Here's the English at our heels; would you have them take in tow  \nAll that's left us of the fleet, linked together stern and bow,  \nFor a prize to Plymouth Sound?—  \nBetter run the ships aground!\"  \n(Ended Damfreville his speech.   ) \n\n\"Not a minute more to wait!  \nLet the captains all and each  \nShove ashore, then blow up, burn the vessels on the beach!  \nFrance must undergo her fate.  \n\n\"Give the word!\"—But no such word  \nWas ever spoke or heard;  \nFor up stood, for out stepped, for in struck amid all these—  \nA captain? A lieutenant? A mate—first, second, third?  \nNo such man of mark, and meet  \nWith his betters to compete!  \nBut a simple Breton sailor pressed by Tourville for the fleet—  \nA poor coasting pilot he, Hervé Riel, the Croisiekese.  \n\nAnd \"What mockery or malice have we here?\" cries Hervé Riel:  \n\"Are you mad, you Malouins? Are you cowards, fools, or rogues?  \nTalk to me of rocks and shoals, me who took the soundings, tell  \nOn my fingers every bank, every shallow, every swell,  \n'Twixt the offing here and Grève where the river disembogues?  \nAre you bought by English gold? Is it love the lying's for?  \nMorn and eve, night and day.  \nHave I piloted your bay,  \nEntered free and anchored fast at the foot of Solidor.  \nBurn the fleet and ruin France? That were worse than fifty Hogues!  \nSirs, they know I speak the truth! Sirs, believe me there's a way!  \nOnly let me lead the line,  \nHave the biggest ship to steer,  \nGet this _Formidable_ clear,  \nMake the others follow mine,  \nAnd I lead them, most and least, by a passage I know well,  \nRight to Solidor past Grève,  \nAnd there lay them safe and sound;  \nAnd if one ship misbehave,  \n——Keel so much as grate the ground,  \nWhy, I've nothing but my life,—here's my head!\" cries Hervé Riel.  \n\nNot a minute more to wait  \n\"Steer us in, then, small and great!  \nTake the helm, lead the line, save the squadron!\" cried its chief.  \nCaptains, give the sailor place!  \nHe is Admiral, in brief.  \nStill the north wind, by God's grace!  \nSee the noble fellow's face  \nAs the big ship, with a bound,  \nClears the entry like a hound,  \nKeeps the passage as its inch of way were the wide sea's profound!  \nSee, safe through shoal and rock,  \nHow they follow in a flock,  \nNot a ship that misbehaves, not a keel that grates the ground,  \nNot a spar that comes to grief!  \nThe peril, see, is past,  \nAll are harboured to the last,  \nAnd just as Hervé Riel hollas \"Anchor!\"—sure as fate,  \nUp the English come—too late!  \n\nSo, the storm subsides to calm:  \nThey see the green trees wave  \nOn the heights o'erlooking Grève.  \nHearts that bled are stanched with balm,  \n\"Just our rapture to enhance,  \nLet the English rake the bay,  \nGnash their teeth and glare askance  \nAs they cannonade away!  \n'Neath rampired Solidor pleasant riding on the Rance!\"  \nHow hope succeeds despair on each Captain's countenance!  \nOut burst all with one accord,  \n\"This is Paradise for Hell!  \nLet France, let France's King  \nThank the man that did the thing!\"  \nWhat a shout, and all one word,  \n\"Hervé Riel!\"  \nAs he stepped in front once more,  \nNot a symptom of surprise  \nIn the frank blue Breton eyes,  \nJust the same man as before.  \n\nThen said Damfreville, \"My friend,  \nI must speak out at the end,  \nThough I find the speaking hard.  \nPraise is deeper than the lips:  \nYou have saved the King his ships,  \nYou must name your own reward.  \n'Faith, our sun was near eclipse!  \nDemand whate'er you will,  \nFrance remains your debtor still.  \nAsk to heart's content and have! or my name's not Damfreville.\"  \n\nThen a beam of fun outbroke  \nOn the bearded mouth that spoke,  \nAs the honest heart laughed through  \nThose frank eyes of Breton blue:  \n\"Since I needs must say my say,  \nSince on board the duty's done,  \nAnd from Malo Roads to Croisic Point, what is it but a run?—  \nSince 'tis ask and have, I may—  \nSince the others go ashore—  \nCome! A good whole holiday!  \nLeave to go and see my wife, whom I call the Belle Aurore!\"  \nThat he asked and that he got,—nothing more.  \n\nName and deed alike are lost:  \nNot a pillar nor a post  \nIn his Croisic keeps alive the feat as it befell;  \nNot a head in white and black  \nOn a single fishing smack,  \nIn memory of the man but for whom had gone to wrack  \nAll that France saved from the fight whence England bore the bell.  \nGo to Paris: rank on rank  \nSearch the heroes flung pell-mell  \nOn the Louvre, face and flank!  \nYou shall look long enough ere you come to Hervé Riel.  \nSo, for better and for worse,  \nHervé Riel, accept my verse!  \nIn my verse, Hervé Riel, do thou once more  \nSave the squadron, honour France, love thy wife the Belle Aurore!  </code>"

They are whimpering to and fro—  \nAnd what should they know of England who only England know?—  \nThe poor little street-bred people that vapour and fume and brag,  \nThey are lifting their heads in the stillness to yelp at the English Flag!  \n\nMust we borrow a clout from the Boer—to plaster anew with dirt?  \nAn Irish liar's bandage, or an English coward's shirt?  \nWe may not speak of England; her Flag's to sell or share.  \nWhat is the Flag of England? Winds of the World, declare!  \n\nThe North Wind blew:—\"From Bergen my steel-shod van-guards go;  \nI chase your lazy whalers home from the Disko floe;  \nBy the great North Lights above me I work the will of God,  \nThat the liner splits on the ice-field or the Dogger fills with cod.  \n\n\"I barred my gates with iron, I shuttered my doors with flame,  \nBecause to force my ramparts your nutshell navies came;  \nI took the sun from their presence, I cut them down with my blast,  \nAnd they died, but the Flag of England blew free ere the spirit passed.  \n\n\"The lean white bear hath seen it in the long, long Arctic night,  \nThe musk-ox knows the standard that flouts the Northern Light:  \nWhat is the Flag of England? Ye have but my bergs to dare,  \nYe have but my drifts to conquer. Go forth, for it is there!\"  \n\nThe South Wind sighed:—\"From The Virgins my mid-sea course was ta'en  \nOver a thousand islands lost in an idle main,  \nWhere the sea-egg flames on the coral and the long-backed breakers croon  \nTheir endless ocean legends to the lazy, locked lagoon.  \n\n\"Strayed amid lonely islets, mazed amid outer keys,  \nI waked the palms to laughter—I tossed the scud in the breeze—  \nNever was isle so little, never was sea so lone,  \nBut over the scud and the palm-trees an English flag was flown.  \n\n\"I have wrenched it free from the halliard to hang for a wisp on the Horn;  \nI have chased it north to the Lizard—ribboned and rolled and torn;  \nI have spread its fold o'er the dying, adrift in a hopeless sea;  \nI have hurled it swift on the slaver, and seen the slave set free.  \n\n\"My basking sunfish know it, and wheeling albatross,  \nWhere the lone wave fills with fire beneath the Southern Cross.  \nWhat is the Flag of England? Ye have but my reefs to dare,  \nYe have but my seas to furrow. Go forth, for it is there!\"  \n\nThe East Wind roared:—\"From the Kuriles, the Bitter Seas, I come,  \nAnd me men call the Home-Wind, for I bring the English home.  \nLook—look well to your shipping! By the breath of my mad typhoon  \nI swept your close-packed Praya and beached your best at Kowloon!  \n\n\"The reeling junks behind me and the racing seas before,  \nI raped your richest roadstead—I plundered Singapore!  \nI set my hand on the Hoogli; as a hooded snake she rose,  \nAnd I flung your stoutest steamers to roost with the startled crows.  \n\n\"Never the lotos closes, never the wild-fowl wake,  \nBut a soul goes out on the East Wind that died for England's sake—  \nMan or woman or suckling, mother or bride or maid—  \nBecause on the bones of the English the English Flag is stayed.  \n\n\"The desert-dust hath dimmed it, the flying wild-ass knows.  \nThe scared white leopard winds it across the taintless snows.  \nWhat is the Flag of England? Ye have but my sun to dare,  \nYe have but my sands to travel. Go forth, for it is there!\"  \n\nThe West Wind called:—\"In squadrons the thoughtless galleons fly  \nThat bear the wheat and cattle lest street-bred people die.  \nThey make my might their porter, they make my house their path,  \nTill I loose my neck from their rudder and whelm them all in my wrath.  \n\n\"I draw the gliding fog-bank as a snake is drawn from the hole;  \nThey bellow one to the other, the frightened ship-bells toll,  \nFor day is a drifting terror till I raise the shroud with my breath,  \nAnd they see strange bows above them and the two go locked to death.  \n\n\"But whether in calm or wrack-wreath, whether by dark or day,  \nI heave them whole to the conger or rip their plates away,  \nFirst of the scattered legions, under a shrieking sky,  \nDipping between the rollers, the English Flag goes by.  \n\n\"The dead dumb fog hath wrapped it—the frozen dews have kissed—  \nThe naked stars have seen it, a fellow-star in the mist.  \nWhat is the Flag of England? Ye have but my breath to dare,  \nYe have but my waves to conquer. Go forth, for it is there!\"  </code>"

    "innerHtml": "\"The Man With the Hoe\" is purely an American product, and every American ought to be proud of it, for we want no such type allowed to be developed in this country as the low-browed peasant of France. This poem is a stroke of genius. The story goes that it so offended a modern plutocrat that he offered a reward of $10,000 to any one who could write an equally good poem in rebuttal. \"The Man With the Hoe\" has won for Edwin Markham the title of \"Poet Laureate of the Labouring Classes.\""

    "innerHtml": "\"The Song of Myself\" is one of Walt Whitman's (1819-92 most characteristic poems. I love the swing and the stride of his great long lines. I love his rough-shod way of trampling down and kicking out of the way the conventionalities that spring up like poisonous mushrooms to make the world a vast labyrinth of petty \"proprieties\" until everything is nasty. I love the oxygen he pours on the world. I love his genius for brotherliness, his picture of the Negro with rolling eyes and the firelock in the corner. These excerpts are some of his best lines.     )"

I do not know what it is any more than he.  \nI guess it must be the flag of my disposition, out of hopeful green stuff woven.  \nOr, I guess it is the handkerchief of the Lord,  \nA scented gift and remembrance designedly dropt,  \nBearing the owner's name some way in the corners, that we may see and remark, and say, \"_Whose?_\"  \n\nAlone far in the wilds and mountains I hunt,  \nWandering amazed at my own lightness and glee,  \nIn the late afternoon choosing a safe spot to pass the night,  \nKindling a fire and broiling the fresh-kill'd game,  \nFalling asleep on the gathered leaves with my dog and gun by my side.  \nThe Yankee clipper is under her sky-sails, she cuts the sparkle and scud,  \nMy eyes settle the land, I bend at her prow or shout joyously from the deck.  \nThe boatman and clam-diggers arose early and stopt for me,  \nI tucked my trouser-ends in my boots and went and had a good time;  \nYou should have been with us that day round the chowder-kettle.  \n\nThe runaway slave came to my house and stopt outside,  \nI heard his motions crackling the twigs of the woodpile,  \nThrough the swung half-door of the kitchen I saw him limpsy and weak,  \nAnd went where he sat on a log and led him in and assured him,  \nAnd brought water and fill'd a tub for his sweated body and bruis'd feet,  \nAnd gave him a room that entered from my own, and gave him some coarse clean clothes,  \nAnd remember perfectly well his revolving eyes and his awkwardness,  \nAnd remember putting plasters on the galls of his neck and ankles;  \nHe staid with me a week before he was recuperated and passed north,  \nI had him sit next me at table, my firelock lean'd in the corner.  \n\nI am the poet of the woman the same as the man,  \nAnd I say it is as great to be a woman as to be a man,  \nAnd I say there is nothing greater than the mother of men.  \n\nI understand the large hearts of heroes,  \nThe courage of present times and all times,  \nHow the skipper saw the crowded and rudderless wreck of the steamship, and Death chasing it up and down the storm,  \nHow he knuckled tight and gave not back an inch and was faithful of days and faithful of nights,  \nAnd chalked in large letters on a board, \"_Be of good cheer, we will not desert you_\";  \nHow he followed with them and tack'd with them three days and would not give it up,  \nHow he saved the drifting company at last,  \nHow the lank loose-gown'd women looked when boated from the side of their prepared graves,  \nHow the silent old-faced infants and the lifted sick, and the sharp-lipp'd unshaved men;  \nAll this I swallow, it tastes good, I like it well, it becomes mine,  \nI am the man, I suffered, I was there.  \nThe disdain and calmness of martyrs,  \nThe mother of old, condemned for a witch, burned with dry wood, her children gazing on,  \nThe hounded slave that flags in the race, leans by the fence blowing, covered with sweat.  \nI am the hounded slave, I wince at the bite of the dogs,  \nHell and despair are upon me, crack and again crack the marksmen,  \nI clutch the rails of the fence, my gore dribs, thinn'd with the ooze of my skin,  \nI fall on the weeds and stones,  \nThe riders spur their unwilling horses, haul close,  \nTaunt my dizzy ears and beat me violently over the head with whip-stocks.  \n\nOld age superbly rising! O welcome, ineffable grace of dying days!  \n\nSee ever so far, there is limitless space outside of that,  \nCount ever so much, there is limitless time around that.  \nMy rendezvous is appointed, it is certain,  \nThe Lord will be there and wait till I come on perfect terms.  \nThe great Camerado, the lover true for whom I pine will be there.  \n\nAnd whoever walks a furlong without sympathy walks to his own funeral drest in his shroud.  \n\nAnd to glance with an eye or show a bean in its pod confounds the learning of all times,  \nAnd there is no trade or employment but the young man following it may become a hero,  \nAnd there is no object so soft but it makes a hub for the wheel'd universe.  \nAnd I say to any man or woman, \"Let your soul stand cool and composed before a million universes.\"  \n\nI see something of God each hour of the twenty-four, and each moment then,  \nIn the faces of men and women I see God, and in my own face in the glass,  \nI find letters from God dropt in the street, and every one is sign'd by God's name,  \nAnd I leave them where they are, for I know that wheresoe'er I go,  \nOthers will punctually come forever and ever.  \n\nListener up there! What have you to confide in me?  \nLook in my face while I snuff the sidle of evening.  \n(Talk honestly, no one else hears you, and I stay only a minute longer.       ) \n\nWho has done his day's work? Who will soonest be through with his supper?  \nWho wishes to walk with me?  \n\nI too am not a bit tamed, I too am untranslatable,  \nI sound my barbaric yawp over the roofs of the world.  </code>"
