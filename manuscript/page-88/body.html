<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">
It might have graced a rosy bower,  
Instead of hiding there.  

Yet there it was content to bloom,  
In modest tints arrayed;  
And there diffused its sweet perfume,  
Within the silent shade.  

Then let me to the valley go,  
This pretty flower to see;  
That I may also learn to grow  
In sweet humility.  </code></pre><p>-Jane Taylor.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
