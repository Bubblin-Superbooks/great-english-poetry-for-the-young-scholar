And solemn chaunts resound between.  

Sometimes on lonely mountain-meres  
I find a magic bark;  
I leap on board: no helmsman steers,  
I float till all is dark.  
A gentle sound, an awful light!  
Three angels bear the holy Grail:  
With folded feet, in stoles of white,  
On sleeping wings they sail.  
Ah, bless√®d vision! blood of God!  
My spirit beats her mortal bars,  
As down dark tides the glory slides,  
And star-like mingles with the stars.  

When on my goodly charger borne  
Thro' dreaming towns I go, </pre></div> </div>
