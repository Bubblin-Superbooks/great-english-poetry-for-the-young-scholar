He cut it short, did the great god Pan  
(How tall it stood in the river!),  
Then drew the pith, like the heart of a man,  
Steadily from the outside ring,  
And notched the poor dry empty thing  
In holes, as he sat by the river.  

"This is the way," laugh'd the great god Pan  
(Laugh'd while he sat by the river),  
"The only way, since gods began  
To make sweet music, they could succeed."  
Then, dropping his mouth to a hole in the reed  
He blew in power by the river.  

Sweet, sweet, sweet, O Pan!  
Piercing sweet by the river! </pre></div> </div>
