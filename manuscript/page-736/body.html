It is a battle-song and a p√¶an of victory.</p><blockquote><p>"The journey is done, the summit attained,<br>And the strong man must go."<br>"I would hate that Death bandaged my eyes and forebore,<br>And bade me creep past."<br>"No! let me taste the whole of it"<br>"The reward of all."  </p></blockquote></div> </div>
