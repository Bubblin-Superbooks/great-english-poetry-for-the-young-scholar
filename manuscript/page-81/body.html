<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">
With large and sinewy hands,  
And the muscles of his brawny arms  
Are strong as iron bands.  

His hair is crisp, and black, and long;  
His face is like the tan;  
His brow is wet with honest sweat,  
He earns whate'er he can,  
And looks the whole world in the face,  
For he owes not any man.  

Week in, week out, from morn till night,  
You can hear his bellows blow;  
You can hear him swing his heavy sledge,  
With measured beat and slow,  
Like a sexton ringing the village bell,  
When the evening sun is low. </pre></div> </div>
