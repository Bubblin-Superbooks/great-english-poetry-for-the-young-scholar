### Home, Sweet Home!

"Home, Sweet Home" (John Howard Payne, 1791-1852 is a poem that reaches into the heart. What is home? A place where we experience independence, safety, privacy, and where we can dispense hospitality. "The family is the true unit."   )

There's no place like Home! there's no place like Home!</p></div> </div>
