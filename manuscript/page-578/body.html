And the little _Revenge_ ran on thro' the long sea-lane between.  

Thousands of their soldiers looked down from their decks and laugh'd,  
Thousands of their seamen made mock at the mad little craft  
Running on and on, till delay'd  
By their mountain-like _San Philip_ that, of fifteen hundred tons,

Took the breath from our sails, and we stay'd.  

And while now the great _San Philip_ hung above us like a cloud  
Whence the thunderbolt will fall </pre></div> </div>
