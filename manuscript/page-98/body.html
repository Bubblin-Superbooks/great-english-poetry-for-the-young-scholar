O! thus be it ever, when freemen shall stand  
Between their loved homes and the war's desolation!  
Blest with victory and peace, may the heav'n-rescued land  
Praise the power that hath made and preserved us a nation.  
Then conquer we must, for our cause it is just,  
And this be our mottoâ€”"_In God is our trust_":  
And the star-spangled banner in triumph shall wave  
O'er the land of the free, and the home of the brave.  </code></pre><p>-Francis Scott Key.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
