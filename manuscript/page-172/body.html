How English love remembers.  

And once again a fire of hell  
Rained on the Russian quarters,  
With scream of shot, and burst of shell,  
And bellowing of the mortars!  

And Irish Nora's eyes are dim  
For a singer, dumb and gory;  
And English Mary mourns for him  
Who sang of "Annie Laurie."  

Sleep, soldiers! still in honoured rest  
Your truth and valour wearing:  
The bravest are the tenderest,â€”  
The loving are the daring.  </code></pre><p>-Bayard Taylor.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
