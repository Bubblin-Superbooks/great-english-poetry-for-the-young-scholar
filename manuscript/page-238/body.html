<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">
When upward-springing, blithe, to greet  
The purpling east!  

Cauld blew the bitter biting north  
Upon thy early, humble birth;  
Yet cheerfully thou glinted forth  
Amid the storm,  
Scarce reared above the parent earth  
Thy tender form.  

The flaunting flowers our gardens yield,  
High sheltering woods and wa's maun shield,  
But thou, beneath the random bield  
O' clod or stane,  
Adorns the histie stibble-field,  
Unseen, alane. </pre></div> </div>
