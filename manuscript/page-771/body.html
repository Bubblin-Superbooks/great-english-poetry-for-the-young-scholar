And it says to them: "Kinsmen, hail!  
We severed have been too long.  
Now let us have done with a worn-out tale—  
The tale of an ancient wrong—  
And our friendship last long as our love doth and be stronger than death is strong."  

Answer them, sons of the self-same race,  
And blood of the self-same clan;  
Let us speak with each other face to face  
And answer as man to man,  
And loyally love and trust each other as none but free men can.  

Now fling them out to the breeze,  
Shamrock, Thistle, and Rose, </pre></div> </div>
