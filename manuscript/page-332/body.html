Den many happy days I squandered,  
Many de songs I sung.  
When I was playing wid my brudder  
Happy was I;  
Oh, take me to my kind old mudder!  
Dere let me live and die.  

One little hut among de bushes,  
One dat I love,  
Still sadly to my memory rushes,  
No matter where I rove.  
When will I see de bees a-humming  
All round de comb?  
When will I hear de banjo tumming,  
Down in my good old home?  

All de world am sad and dreary, </pre></div> </div>
