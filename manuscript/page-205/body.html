Heard the lapping of the water,  
Sounds of music, words of wonder;  
"Minnie-wawa!" said the pine-trees,  
"Mudway-aushka!" said the water;  
Saw the fire-fly, Wah-wah-taysee,  
Flitting through the dusk of evening,  
With the twinkle of its candle  
Lighting up the brakes and bushes,  
And he sang the song of children.  

Sang the song Nokomis taught him:  
"Wah-wah-taysee, little fire-fly,  
Little, flitting, white-fire insect,  
Little, dancing, white-fire creature,  
Light me with your little candle,  
Ere upon my bed I lay me,  
Ere in sleep I close my eyelids!" </pre></div> </div>
