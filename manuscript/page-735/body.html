But I need, now as then,  
Thee, God, who mouldest men;  
And since, not even while the whirl was worst  
Did I,—to the wheel of life  
With shapes and colours rife,  
Bound dizzily,—mistake my end, to slake Thy thirst:  

So, take and use Thy work:  
Amend what flaws may lurk,  
What strain o' the stuff, what warpings past the aim!  
My times be in Thy hand!  
Perfect the cup as plann'd!  
Lest age approve of youth, and death complete the same! </code></pre><p>-Robert Browning.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
