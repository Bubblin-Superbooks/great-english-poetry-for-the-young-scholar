And hindereth me from sailing!  

Old Past, let go, and drop i' the sea  
Till fathomless waters cover thee!  
For I am living, but thou art dead;  
Thou drawest back, I strive ahead  
The Day to find.  
Thy shells unbind! Night comes behind;  
I needs must hurry with the wind  
And trim me best for sailing. </code></pre><p>-Sidney Lanier.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
