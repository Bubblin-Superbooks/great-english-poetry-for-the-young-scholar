Surely she will come again!  
Call her once and come away;  
This way, this way!  
"Mother dear, we cannot stay!  
The wild white horses foam and fret."  
Margaret! Margaret!  

Come, dear children, come away down;  
Call no more!  
One last look at the white-wall'd town,  
And the little gray church on the windy shore;  
Then come down!  
She will not come though you call all day;  
Come away, come away!  

Children dear, was it yesterday  
We heard the sweet bells over the bay? </pre></div> </div>
