We dare not ram, for she can run;  
And dare ye fire another gun,  
And die in the peeling steam?"  

It was our war-ship _Clampherdown_  
That carried an armour-belt;  
But fifty feet at stern and bow,  
Lay bare as the paunch of the purser's sow,  
To the hail of the Nordenfeldt.

The chilled steel bolts are swift!  
We have emptied the bunkers in open sea,  
Their shrapnel bursts where our coal should be."  
And he answered, "Let her drift."
