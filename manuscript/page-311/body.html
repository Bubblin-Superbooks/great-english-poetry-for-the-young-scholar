That bright dream was his last;  
He woke—to hear his sentries shriek,  
"To arms! they come! the Greek! the Greek!"  
He woke—to die midst flame, and smoke,  
And shout, and groan, and sabre-stroke,  
And death-shots falling thick and fast  
As lightnings from the mountain-cloud;  
And heard, with voice as trumpet loud,  
Bozzaris cheer his band:  
"Strike—till the last armed foe expires;  
Strike—for your altars and your fires;  
Strike—for the green graves of your sires;  
God—and your native land!"  

They fought—like brave men, long and well;  
They piled that ground with Moslem slain,  
They conquered—but Bozzaris fell, </pre></div> </div>
