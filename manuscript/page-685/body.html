<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">both adore—  
Tell this soul, with sorrow laden, if, within the distant Aiden  
It shall clasp a sainted maiden, whom the angels name Lenore!  
Clasp a rare and radiant maiden, whom the angels name Lenore?"  
Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."  

"Be that our sign of parting, bird or fiend," I shrieked, upstarting—  
"Get thee back into the tempest and the night's Plutonian shore;  
Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken,  
Leave my loneliness unbroken—quit the bust above my door,  
Take thy beak from out my heart and take thy form</pre></div> </div>
