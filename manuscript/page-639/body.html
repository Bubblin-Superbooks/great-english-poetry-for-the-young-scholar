Leave me the reed unplucked beside the stream.  
And he will stoop and fill it with the breeze;  
Leave me the viol's frame in secret trees,  
Unwrought, and it shall wake a druid theme;  
Leave me the whispering shell on Nereid shores.  
The God of Music dwelleth out of doors. </code></pre><p>-Edith M. Thomas.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
