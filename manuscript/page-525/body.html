<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">glowing,<br>And quick to the white-pebbled bottom it fell;<br>Then soon, with the emblem of truth overflowing,<br>And dripping with coolness, it rose from the well—<br>The old oaken bucket, the iron-bound bucket,<br>The moss-covered bucket arose from the well.</p><p>How sweet from the green mossy brim to receive it<br>As poised on the curb it inclined to my lips!  
Not a full blushing goblet could tempt me to leave it,<br>The brightest that beauty or revelry sips.<br>And now, far removed from the loved habitation,<br>The tear of regret will intrusively swell.<br>As fancy reverts to my father's plantation,<br>And sighs for the bucket that hangs in the well—<br>The old oaken bucket, the iron-bound bucket,<br>The moss-covered bucket that hangs in the well!</p></div> </div>
