Chee, chee, chee.  

Six white eggs on a bed of hay,  
Flecked with purple, a pretty sight:  
There as the mother sits all day,  
Robert is singing with all his might,  
Bob-o'-link, bob-o'-link,  
Spink, spank, spink,  
Nice good wife that never goes out,  
Keeping house while I frolic about.  
Chee, chee, chee.  

Soon as the little ones chip the shell,  
Six wide mouths are open for food;  
Robert of Lincoln bestirs him well,  
Gathering seeds for the hungry brood:  
Bob-o'-link, bob-o'-link, </pre></div> </div>
