This poem holds much to comfort and control people who are shut up to the joys of meditation—people to whom the world of activity is closed. To be independent of things material—this is the soul's pleasure.</p><pre class="  "><code>My mind to me a kingdom is;  
Such perfect joy therein I find  
As far excels all earthly bliss  
That God or Nature hath assigned;  
Though much I want that most would have,  
Yet still my mind forbids to crave. </pre></div> </div>
