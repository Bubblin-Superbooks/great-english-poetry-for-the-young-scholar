Is trimmed with stripe of black;  
A furry plume to match it  
Is curling o'er his back;  
New curved with every motion,  
His plume curls o'er his back.  

No little new-born baby  
Has pinker feet than he;  
Each tiny toe is cushioned  
With velvet cushions three;

Might tempt an angel's kiss"?  
I know a score of school-boys  
Who put their lips to this,â€” </pre></div> </div>
