<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">
As the bird beneath their eaves.  

The free, fair homes of England!  
Long, long, in hut and hall  
May hearts of native proof be reared  
To guard each hallowed wall!  
And green forever be the groves,  
And bright the flowery sod,  
Where first the child's glad spirit loves  
Its country and its God! </code></pre><p>-Felicia Hemans.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
