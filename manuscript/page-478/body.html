<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">sigh;<br>For the cold strange eyes of a little Mermaiden,<br>And the gleam of her golden hair.</p><p>Come away, away, children;<br>Come, children, come down!  
The hoarse wind blows colder;<br>Lights shine in the town.<br>She will start from her slumber<br>When gusts shake the door;<br>She will hear the winds howling,<br>Will hear the waves roar.<br>We shall see, while above us<br>The waves roar and whirl,<br>A ceiling of amber,<br>A pavement of pearl.<br>Singing: "Here came a mortal,<br>But faithless was she!  
And alone dwell forever<br>The kings of the sea."</p></div> </div>
