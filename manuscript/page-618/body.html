<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h3>The Light Of Other Days.</h3><pre class="  "><code>Oft in the stilly night  
Ere slumber's chain has bound me,  
Fond Memory brings the light  
Of other days around me:  
The smiles, the tears  
Of boyhood's years,  
The words of love then spoken;  
The eyes that shone,  
Now dimmed and gone,  
The cheerful hearts now broken!  
Thus in the stilly night  
Ere slumber's chain has bound me,  
Sad Memory brings the light  
Of other days around me. </pre></div> </div>
