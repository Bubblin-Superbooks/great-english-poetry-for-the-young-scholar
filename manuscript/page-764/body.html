Emerson teaches one lesson above all others, that each soul must work out for itself its latent force, its own individual expression, and that with a "sad sincerity." "The bishop of the soul" can do no more.     )</p><pre class="  "><code>I like a church; I like a cowl;  
I love a prophet of the soul;  
And on my heart monastic aisles  
Fall like sweet strains, or pensive smiles:  
Yet not for all his faith can see  
Would I that cowl√®d churchman be. </pre></div> </div>
