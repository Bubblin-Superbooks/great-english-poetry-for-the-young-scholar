With all the hireling chivalry of Guelders and Almayne.  
Now by the lips of those ye love, fair gentlemen of France,  
Charge for the golden lilies,â€”upon them with the lance.  
A thousand spurs are striking deep, a thousand spears in rest,  
A thousand knights are pressing close behind the snow-white crest;  
And in they burst, and on they rushed, while like a guiding star,  
Amid the thickest carnage blazed the helmet of Navarre.  

Now, God be praised, the day is ours. Mayenne hath turned his rein.  
D'Aumale hath cried for quarter. The Flemish count is slain. </pre></div> </div>
