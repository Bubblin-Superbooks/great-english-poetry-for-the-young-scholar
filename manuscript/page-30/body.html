### Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star.
</code></pre><p>Twinkle, twinkle, little star!  
How I wonder what you are,<br>Up above the world so high,<br>Like a diamond in the sky.</p><p>When the glorious sun is set,<br>When the grass with dew is wet,<br>Then you show your little light,<br>Twinkle, twinkle all the night.</p><p>In the dark-blue sky you keep,<br>And often through my curtains peep,<br>For you never shut your eye,<br>Till the sun is in the sky.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">As your bright and tiny</p></div> </div>
