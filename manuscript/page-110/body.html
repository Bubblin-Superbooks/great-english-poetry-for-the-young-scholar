There were cities with temples and towers, and these  
All pictured in silver sheen!  

But he did one thing that was hardly fair;  
He peeped in the cupboard, and finding there  
That all had forgotten for him to prepareâ€”

I'll bite this basket of fruit," said he,  
"This costly pitcher I'll burst in three,  
And the glass of water they've left for me  
Shall '_tchich!_' to tell them I'm drinking."  </code></pre><p>-Hannah Flagg Gould.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
