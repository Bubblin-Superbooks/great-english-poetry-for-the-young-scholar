Not free from boding thoughts, a while  
The Shepherd stood: then makes his way  
Toward the Dog, o'er rocks and stones,  
As quickly as he may;  
Nor far had gone, before he found  
A human skeleton on the ground;  
The appalled discoverer with a sigh  
Looks round, to learn the history.  

From those abrupt and perilous rocks  
The Man had fallen, that place of fear!  
At length upon the Shepherd's mind  
It breaks, and all is clear:  
He instantly recalled the name,  
And who he was, and whence he came;  
Remembered, too, the very day </pre></div> </div>
