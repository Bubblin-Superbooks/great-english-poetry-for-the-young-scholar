The Lady Ruth's great bureau,  
Each foot a dragon's paw!  
The midget ate the nails from  
His famous antique claw.  
Oh, what a cruel beastie  
To hurt a dragon's claw!  

To autographic copies  
Upon my choicest shelf,â€”  
To every dainty volume  
The rogue has helped himself.  
My books! Oh dear! No matter!  
The rogue has helped himself.  

And yet, my little squirrel,  
Your taste is not so bad; </pre></div> </div>
