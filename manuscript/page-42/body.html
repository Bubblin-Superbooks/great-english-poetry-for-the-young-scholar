I have taught it to a great many very young boys, and not one has ever tried to evade learning it. Older pupils like it equally well.</p><pre class="  "><code>I have a little shadow that goes in and out with me,  
And what can be the use of him is more than I can see.  
He is very, very like me from the heels up to the head;  
And I see him jump before me, when I jump into my bed.  

The funniest thing about him is the way he likes to</pre></div> </div>
