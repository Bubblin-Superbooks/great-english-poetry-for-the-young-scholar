Long has it waved on high,<br>And many an eye has danced to see<br>That banner in the sky;<br>Beneath it rung the battle shout,<br>And burst the cannon's roar;â€”<br>The meteor of the ocean air<br>Shall sweep the clouds no more.</p><p>Her deck, once red with heroes' blood,<br>Where knelt the vanquished foe,<br>When winds were hurrying o'er the flood<br>And waves were white below.<br>No more shall feel the victor's tread,<br>Or know the conquered knee;<br>The harpies of the shore shall pluck<br>The eagle of the sea!</p></div> </div>
