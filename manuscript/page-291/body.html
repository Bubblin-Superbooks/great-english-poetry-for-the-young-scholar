Among the scattered rocks;  
And now at distance can discern  
A stirring in a brake of fern;  
And instantly a Dog is seen,  
Glancing through that covert green.  

The Dog is not of mountain breed;  
Its motions, too, are wild and shy;  
With something, as the Shepherd thinks,  
Unusual in its cry:  
Nor is there any one in sight  
All round, in hollow or on height;  
Nor shout, nor whistle strikes his ear;  
What is the Creature doing here?  

It was a cove, a huge recess,  
That keeps, till June, December's snow. </pre></div> </div>
