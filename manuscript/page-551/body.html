At cards for kisses. Cupid paid.  
He stakes his quiver, bow and arrows,  
His mother's doves and team of sparrows.  
Loses them, too; then down he throws  
The coral of his lips, the rose  
Growing on his cheek, but none knows how;  
With them the crystal of his brow,  
And then the dimple of his chin.  
All these did my Campasbe win.  
At last he set her both his eyes;  
She won and Cupid blind did rise.  
Oh, Love, hath she done this to thee!  
What shall, alas, become of me!  </code></pre></div> </div>
