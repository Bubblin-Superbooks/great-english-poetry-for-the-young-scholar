Looked out a face that the father knew.  

For close-barred prisons will sometimes yawn,  
And yield their dead unto life again;  
And the day that comes with a cloudy dawn,  
In golden glory at last may wane.  

The great tears sprang to their meeting eyes;  
For the heart must speak when the lips are dumb,  
And under the silent evening skies  
Together they followed the cattle home.  </code></pre><p>-Kate Putnam Osgood.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
