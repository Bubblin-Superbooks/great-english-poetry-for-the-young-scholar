To give thy soul its bent,  
Try thee and turn thee forth, sufficiently impress'd.  

What though the earlier grooves  
Which ran the laughing loves  
Around thy base, no longer pause and press?  
What though, about thy rim,  
Scull-things in order grim  
Grow out, in graver mood, obey the sterner stress?  

Look not thou down but up!  
To uses of a cup,  
The festal board, lamp's flash and trumpet's peal,  
The new wine's foaming flow,  
The master's lips aglow!  
Thou, heaven's consummate cup, what need'st thou with earth's wheel? </pre></div> </div>
