And Nod.  

All night long their nets they threw  
To the stars in the twinkling foam,â€”  
Then down from the skies came the wooden shoe,  
Bringing the fishermen home:  
'Twas all so pretty a sail, it seemed  
As if it could not be;  
And some folk thought 'twas a dream they'd dreamed  
Of sailing that beautiful sea;  
But I shall name you the fishermen three:  
Wynken,  
Blynken,  
And Nod.  

Wynken and Blynken are two little eyes,  
And Nod is a little head, </pre></div> </div>
