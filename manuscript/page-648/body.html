Save where full fyve good miles away  
The steeple tower'd from out the greene;  
And lo! the great bell farre and wide  
Was heard in all the country side  
That Saturday at eventide.  

The swanherds where their sedges are  
Mov'd on in sunset's golden breath,  
The shepherde lads I heard afarre,  
And my sonne's wife, Elizabeth;  
Till floating o'er the grassy sea  
Came downe that kyndly message free,  
The "Brides of Mavis Enderby."  

Then some look'd uppe into the sky,  
And all along where Lindis flows  
To where the goodly vessels lie, </pre></div> </div>
