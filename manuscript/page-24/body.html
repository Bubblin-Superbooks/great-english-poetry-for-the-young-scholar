<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">
It fell to earth, I knew not where;  
For who has sight so keen and strong  
That it can follow the flight of song?  

Long, long afterward, in an oak  
I found the arrow, still unbroke;  
And the song, from beginning to end,  
I found again in the heart of a friend.  </code></pre><p>- Henry W. Longfellow.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
