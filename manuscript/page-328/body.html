'Tis summer, the darkeys are gay;  
The corn-top's ripe, and the meadow's in the bloom,  
While the birds make music all the day.  
The young folks roll on the little cabin floor,  
All merry, all happy and bright;  
By-'n'-by hard times comes a-knocking at the door:â€”  
Then my old Kentucky home, good-night!  

Weep no more, my lady,  
O, weep no more to-day!  
We will sing one song for the old Kentucky home,  
For the old Kentucky home, far away. </pre></div> </div>
