<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h3>The Skylark.</h3><pre class="  "><code>Bird of the wilderness,  
Blithesome and cumberless,  
Sweet be thy matin o'er moorland and lea!  
Emblem of happiness,  
Blest is thy dwelling-placeâ€”  
Oh, to abide in the desert with thee!  

Wild is thy lay and loud,  
Far in the downy cloud,  
Love gives it energy, love gave it birth.  
Where, on thy dewy wing,  
Where art thou journeying?  
Thy lay is in heaven, thy love is on earth.  

O'er fell and fountain sheen,  
O'er moor and mountain green, </pre></div> </div>
