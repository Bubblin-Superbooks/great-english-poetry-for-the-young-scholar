Bright jewels of the mine?  
The wealth of seas, the spoils of war?â€”  
They sought a faith's pure shrine!  

Ay! call it holy ground,  
The soil where first they trod:  
They have left unstained what there they found,  
Freedom to worship God. </code></pre><p>-Felicia Hemans.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
