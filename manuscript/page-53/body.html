We had one poetry hour every week, and he studied and recited it with unabated interest to the end of the year.</p><pre class="  "><code>Wee Willie Winkie rins through the town,  
Up-stairs and doon-stairs, in his nicht-gown,  
Tirlin' at the window, cryin' at the lock,  
"Are the weans in their bed?â€”for it's now ten o'clock."  

Hey, Willie Winkie! are ye comin' ben? </pre></div> </div>
