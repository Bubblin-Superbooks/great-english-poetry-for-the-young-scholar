Then from those cavernous eyes  
Pale flashes seemed to rise,  
As when the Northern skies  
Gleam in December;  
And, like the water's flow  
Under December's snow,  
Came a dull voice of woe  
From the heart's chamber.

No Skald in song has told,  
No Saga taught thee!  
Take heed that in thy verse  
Thou dost the tale rehearse,  
Else dread a dead man's curse; </pre></div> </div>
