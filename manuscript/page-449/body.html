For each could swim on the ocean's brim,  
And, when wearied, its sail could furl,  
And sink to sleep in the great sea-deep,  
In its palace all of pearl.  

And theirs was a bliss more fair than this  
Which we taste in our colder clime;  
For they were rife in a tropic lifeâ€”  
A brighter and better clime.

Were dimmed by no alloy;  
Whose groves were palm, whose air was balm,  
And life one only joy.  

They sailed all day through creek and bay, </pre></div> </div>
