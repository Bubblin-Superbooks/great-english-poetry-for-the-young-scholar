As he looked, there came a man from his farm;  
He had a countenance white with alarm:  
"My Lord, I opened your granaries this morn,  
And the Rats had eaten all your corn."  

Another came running presently,  
And he was pale as pale could be:  
"Fly, my Lord Bishop, fly!" quoth he,  
"Ten thousand Rats are coming this way;  
The Lord forgive you yesterday!"

"'Tis the safest place in Germany;  
The walls are high, and the shores are steep,  
And the stream is strong, and the water deep." </pre></div> </div>
