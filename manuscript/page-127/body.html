Robert of Lincoln's a hum-drum drone;  
Off he flies, and we sing as he goes,  
Bob-o'-link, bob-o'-link,  
Spink, spank, spink,  
When you can pipe that merry old strain,  
Robert of Lincoln, come back again.  
Chee, chee, chee.  </code></pre><p>-William Cullen Bryant.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
