"The Flying Squirrel" is an honest account of a live creature that won his way into scores of hearts by his mad pranks and affectionate ways. It is enough that John Burroughs has commended the poem.
</code></pre><p>Of all the woodland creatures,<br>The quaintest little sprite<br>Is the dainty flying squirrel<br>In vest of shining white,<br>In coat of silver gray,<br>And vest of shining white.</p><p>His furry Quaker jacket<br>Is trimmed with stripe of black;<br>A furry plume to match it<br>Is curling o'er his back;<br>New curved with every motion,<br>His plume curls o'er his back.</p></div> </div>
