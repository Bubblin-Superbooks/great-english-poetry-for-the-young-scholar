What is he but a brute  
Whose flesh has soul to suit,  
Whose spirit works lest arms and legs want play?  
To man, propose this testâ€”  
Thy body at its best,  
How far can that project thy soul on its lone way?  

Yet gifts should prove their use:  
I own the Past profuse  
Of power each side, perfection every turn:  
Eyes, ears took in their dole,  
Brain treasured up the whole:  
Should not the heart beat once "How good to live and learn?"  

Not once beat "Praise be Thine! </pre></div> </div>
