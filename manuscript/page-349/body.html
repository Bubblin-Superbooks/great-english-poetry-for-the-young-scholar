The sun in heaven was shining gay;  
All things were joyful on that day;  
The sea-birds screamed as they wheeled round,  
And there was joyance in their sound.  

The buoy of the Inchcape Bell was seen,  
A dark spot on the ocean green;  
Sir Ralph the Rover walked his deck,  
And he fixed his eye on the darker speck.  

He felt the cheering power of spring;  
It made him whistle, it made him sing:  
His heart was mirthful to excess,  
But the Rover's mirth was wickedness.  

His eye was on the Inchcape float. </pre></div> </div>
