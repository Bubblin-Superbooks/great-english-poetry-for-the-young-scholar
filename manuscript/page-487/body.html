Alone stood brave Horatius,  
But constant still in mind;  
Thrice thirty thousand foes before,  
And the broad flood behind.  
"Down with him!" cried false Sextus,  
With a smile on his pale face.  
"Now yield thee," cried Lars Porsena,  
"Now yield thee to our grace."  

Round turned he, as not deigning  
Those craven ranks to see;  
Naught spake he to Lars Porsena,  
To Sextus naught spake he;  
But he saw on Palatinus  
The white porch of his home;  
And he spake to the noble river </pre></div> </div>
