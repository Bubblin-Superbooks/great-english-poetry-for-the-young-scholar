With a jingle of bells as the dusk gathers in,  
He turns to the foot-path that leads up the hill—  
The bags on his back, and a cloth round his chin,  
And, tucked in his belt, the Post-Office bill;—  
"Despatched on this date, as received by the rail,  
_Per_ runner, two bags of the Overland-Mail."  

Is the torrent in spate? He must ford it or swim.  
Has the rain wrecked the road? He must climb by the cliff.  
Does the tempest cry "Halt"? What are tempests to him?  
The service admits not a "but" or an "if";  
While the breath's in his mouth, he must bear without fail,  
In the name of the Empress the Overland-Mail. </pre></div> </div>
