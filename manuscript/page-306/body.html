<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">
Hark to the summons!  
Come in your war-array,  
Gentles and commons.  

Come from deep glen, and  
From mountain so rocky,  
The war-pipe and pennon  
Are at Inverlochy.  
Come every hill-plaid, and  
True heart that wears one,  
Come every steel blade, and  
Strong hand that bears one.  

Leave untended the herd,  
The flock without shelter;  
Leave the corpse uninterr'd,  
The bride at the altar; </pre></div> </div>
