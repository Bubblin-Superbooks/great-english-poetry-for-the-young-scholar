Come away, away, children;  
Come, children, come down!  
The hoarse wind blows colder;  
Lights shine in the town.  
She will start from her slumber  
When gusts shake the door;  
She will hear the winds howling,  
Will hear the waves roar.  
We shall see, while above us  
The waves roar and whirl,  
A ceiling of amber,  
A pavement of pearl.  
Singing: "Here came a mortal,  
But faithless was she!  
And alone dwell forever  
The kings of the sea." </pre></div> </div>
