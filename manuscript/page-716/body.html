And read their history in a nation's eyes,  

Their lot forbad: nor circumscribed alone  
Their growing virtues, but their crimes confined  
Forbad to wade through slaughter to a throne,  
And shut the gates of mercy on mankind,  

The struggling pangs of conscious truth to hide,  
To quench the blushes of ingenuous shame,  
Or heap the shrine of Luxury and Pride  
With incense, kindled at the Muse's flame.  

Far from the madding crowd's ignoble strife,  
Their sober wishes never learn'd to stray;  
Along the cool sequester'd vale of life  
They kept the noiseless tenour of their way. </pre></div> </div>
