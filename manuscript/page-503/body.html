### The Brides of Enderby.

"The Brides of Enderby," by Jean Ingelow (1830-97). This poem is very dramatic, and the music of the refrain has done much to make it popular. But the pathos is that which endears it.

Ply all your changes, all your swells,<br>Play uppe, 'The Brides of Enderby.'"</p></div> </div>
