And the ammonite was no more.  

So the nautilus now in its shelly prow,  
As over the deep it strays,  
Still seems to seek, in bay and creek,  
Its companion of other days.  

And alike do we, on life's stormy sea,  
As we roam from shore to shore,  
Thus tempest-tossed, seek the loved, the lost,  
And find them on earth no more.  

Yet the hope how sweet, again to meet,  
As we look to a distant strand,  
Where heart meets heart, and no more they part  
Who meet in that better land.  </code></pre><p>-Anonymous.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
