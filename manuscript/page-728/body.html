What weapons to select, what armour to indue.  

Youth ended, I shall try  
My gain or loss thereby;  
Leave the fire ashes, what survives is gold:  
And I shall weigh the same,  
Give life its praise or blame:  
Young, all lay in dispute; I shall know, being old.  

For note, when evening shuts,  
A certain moment cuts  
The deed off, calls the glory from the gray:  
A whisper from the west  
Shootsâ€”"Add this to the rest,  
Take it and try its worth: here dies another day."  

So, still within this life, </pre></div> </div>
