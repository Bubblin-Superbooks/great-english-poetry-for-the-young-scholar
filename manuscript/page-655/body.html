<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">
From the meads where melick groweth,  
When the water winding down,  
Onward floweth to the town.  

I shall never see her more  
Where the reeds and rushes quiver,  
Shiver, quiver;  
Stand beside the sobbing river,  
Sobbing, throbbing, in its falling  
To the sandy lonesome shore;  
I shall never hear her calling,  
"Leave your meadow grasses mellow,  
Mellow, mellow;  
Quit your cowslips, cowslips yellow;  

"Come uppe, Whitefoot, come uppe, Lightfoot;  
Quit your pipes of parsley hollow, </pre></div> </div>
