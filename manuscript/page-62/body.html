And the wooden shoe that sailed the skies  
Is a wee one's trundle-bed;  
So shut your eyes while Mother sings  
Of wonderful sights that be,  
And you shall see the beautiful things  
As you rock on the misty sea  
Where the old shoe rocked the fishermen three,  
Wynken,  
Blynken,  
And Nod. </code></pre><p>-Eugene Field.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
