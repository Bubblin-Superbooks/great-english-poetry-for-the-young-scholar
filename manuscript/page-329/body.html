<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">Here is another old reading-book gem that will always be dear to every boy's heart if he only reads it a few times.
</code></pre><p>There was a sound of revelry by night,<br>And Belgium's capital had gathered then<br>Her beauty and her chivalry, and bright<br>The lamps shone o'er fair women and brave men.<br>A thousand hearts beat happily; and when<br>Music arose with its voluptuous swell,<br>Soft eyes looked love to eyes which spake again,<br>And all went merry as a marriage-bell:<br>But hush! hark! a deep sound strikes like a rising knell!</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Did ye not hear it? No; 'twas but the wind,<br>Or the car rattling o'er the stony street.<br>On with the dance! let joy be unconfined!  
No sleep till morn, when Youth and Pleasure meet<br>To chase the glowing hours with flying feet!  
But hark!â€”that heavy sound breaks in once</p></div> </div>
