They hunt no more for the 'possum and the coon,  
On the meadow, the hill, and the shore;  
They sing no more by the glimmer of the moon,  
On the bench by the old cabin door.  
The day goes by like a shadow o'er the heart,  
With sorrow, where all was delight;  
The time has come when the darkeys have to part:—  
Then my old Kentucky home, good-night!  

The head must bow, and the back will have to bend,  
Wherever the darkey may go;  
A few more days, and the trouble all will end,  
In the field where the sugar-canes grow.  
A few more days for to tote the weary load,—  
No matter, 'twill never be light;  
A few more days till we totter on the road:— </pre></div> </div>
