They rang the sailor lads to guide  
From roofe to roofe who fearless row'd;  
And Iâ€”my sonne was at my side,  
And yet the ruddy beacon glow'd:  
And yet he moan'd beneath his breath,  
"O come in life, or come in death!  
O lost! my love, Elizabeth."  

And didst thou visit him no more?  
Thou didst, thou didst, my daughter deare  
The waters laid thee at his doore,  
Ere yet the early dawn was clear.  
Thy pretty bairns in fast embrace,  
The lifted sun shone on thy face,  
Downe drifted to thy dwelling-place. </pre></div> </div>
