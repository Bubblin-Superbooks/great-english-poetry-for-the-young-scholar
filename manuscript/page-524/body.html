I was not ever thus, nor prayed that Thou  
Shouldst lead me on;  
I loved to choose and see my path; but now  
Lead Thou me on.  
I loved the garish day; and, spite of fears,  
Pride ruled my will: remember not past years.  

So long Thy power hath blest me, sure it still  
Will lead me on  
O'er moor and fen, o'er crag and torrent, till  
The night is gone,  
And with the morn those angel faces smile,  
Which I have loved long since, and lost a while.  </code></pre><p>-John Henry Newman.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
