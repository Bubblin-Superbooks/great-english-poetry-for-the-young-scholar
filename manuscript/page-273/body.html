For still the broader the Moon-scrap grew,  
The broader he swelled his big cheeks and blew.  

Slowly she grew—till she filled the night,  
And shone  
On her throne  
In the sky alone,  
A matchless, wonderful silvery light,  
Radiant and lovely, the queen of the night.  

Said the Wind: "What a marvel of power am I  
With my breath,  
Good faith!  
I blew her to death—  
First blew her away right out of the sky—  
Then blew her in; what strength have I!" </pre></div> </div>
