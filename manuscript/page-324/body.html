Sign of a nation, great and strong  
Toward her people from foreign wrong:  
Pride and glory and honour,â€”all  
Live in the colours to stand or fall.  

Hats off!  
Along the street there comes  
A blare of bugles, a ruffle of drums;  
And loyal hearts are beating high:  
Hats off!  
The flag is passing by!  </code></pre><p>-Henry Holcomb Bennett.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
