I see the whole design,  
I, who saw power, see now love perfect too:  
Perfect I call Thy plan:  
Thanks that I was a man!  
Maker, remake, complete,—I trust what Thou shalt do!"  

For pleasant is this flesh,  
Our soul, in its rose-mesh  
Pull'd ever to the earth, still yearns for rest;  
Would we some prize might hold  
To match those manifold  
Possessions of the brute,—gain most, as we did best!  

Let us not always say,  
"Spite of this flesh to-day  
I strove, made head, gained ground upon the whole!" </pre></div> </div>
