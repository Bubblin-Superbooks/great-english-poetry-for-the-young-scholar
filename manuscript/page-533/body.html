<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h3>America.</h3><p class="  start-chapter">"America" (Samuel Francis Smith, 1808-95 is a good poem to learn as a poem, regardless of the fact that every American who can sing it ought to know it, that he may join in the chorus when patriotic celebrations call for it. My boys love to repeat the entire poem, but I often find masses of people trying to sing it, knowing only one stanza. It is our national anthem, and a part of our education to know every word of it.     )</p><pre class="  "><code>My country, 'tis of thee,  
Sweet land of liberty,  
Of thee I sing;  
Land where my fathers died, </pre></div> </div>
