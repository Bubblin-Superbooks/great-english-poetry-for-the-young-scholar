Nor any unproportion'd thought his act.  
Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar:  
The friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,  
Grapple them to thy soul with hoops of steel;  
But do not dull thy palm with entertainment  
Of each new-hatch'd, unfledg'd comrade. Beware  
Of entrance to a quarrel; but, being in,  
Bear 't that th' opposed may beware of thee.  
Give every man thine ear, but few thy voice:  
Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment.  
Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy  
But not expressed in fancy; rich, not gaudy:  
For the apparel oft proclaims the man.  
Neither a borrower nor a lender be;  
For loan oft loses both itself and friend, </pre></div> </div>
