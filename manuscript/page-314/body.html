Thy grasp is welcome as the hand  
Of brother in a foreign land;  
Thy summons welcome as the cry  
That told the Indian isles were nigh  
To the world-seeking Genoese,  
When the land wind, from woods of palm,  
And orange-groves, and fields of balm,  
Blew o'er the Haytian seas.  

Bozzaris! with the storied brave  
Greece nurtured in her glory's time,  
Rest theeâ€”there is no prouder grave,  
Even in her own proud clime.  
She wore no funeral-weeds for thee,  
Nor bade the dark hearse wave its plume  
Like torn branch from death's leafless tree  
In sorrow's pomp and pageantry, </pre></div> </div>
