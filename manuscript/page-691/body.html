There sounds not to the trump of fame  
The echo of a nobler name.  
Unmarked he stood amid the throng,  
In rumination deep and long,  
Till you might see, with sudden grace,  
The very thought come o'er his face;  
And, by the motion of his form,  
Anticipate the bursting storm,  
And, by the uplifting of his brow,  
Tell where the bolt would strike, and how.  

But 'twas no sooner thought than done!  
The field was in a moment won;  
"Make way for liberty!" he cried,  
Then ran, with arms extended wide,  
As if his dearest friend to clasp;  
Ten spears he swept within his grasp. </pre></div> </div>
