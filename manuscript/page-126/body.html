Spink, spank, spink,  
This new life is likely to be  
Hard for a gay young fellow like me.  
Chee, chee, chee.  

Robert of Lincoln at length is made  
Sober with work, and silent with care,  
Off is his holiday garment laid,  
Half forgotten that merry air,  
Bob-o'-link, bob-o'-link,  
Spink, spank, spink,  
Nobody knows but my mate and I,  
Where our nest and our nestlings lie.  
Chee, chee, chee.  

Summer wanes; the children are grown;  
Fun and frolic no more he knows; </pre></div> </div>
