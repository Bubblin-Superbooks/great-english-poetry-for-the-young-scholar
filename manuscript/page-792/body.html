<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">sparkle and scud,  
My eyes settle the land, I bend at her prow or shout joyously from the deck.  
The boatman and clam-diggers arose early and stopt for me,  
I tucked my trouser-ends in my boots and went and had a good time;  
You should have been with us that day round the chowder-kettle.  

The runaway slave came to my house and stopt outside,  
I heard his motions crackling the twigs of the woodpile,  
Through the swung half-door of the kitchen I saw him limpsy and weak,  
And went where he sat on a log and led him in and assured him,  
And brought water and fill'd a tub for his sweated body and bruis'd feet, </pre></div> </div>
