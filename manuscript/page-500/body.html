Shall fraud and force and iron will  
Oppress the weak and helpless still!  
What shall the tasks of mercy be,  
Amid the toils, the strifes, the tears  
Of those who live when length of years  
Is wasting this apple-tree?  

"Who planted this old apple-tree?"  
The children of that distant day  
Thus to some aged man shall say;  
And, gazing on its mossy stem,  
The gray-haired man shall answer them:  
"A poet of the land was he,  
Born in the rude but good old times;  
'Tis said he made some quaint old rhymes  
On planting the apple-tree." </code></pre><p>-William Cullen Bryant.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
