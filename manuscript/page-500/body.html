### A Musical Instrument.

"A Musical Instrument" by Elizabeth Barrett Browning (1806-61). This poem is the supreme masterpiece of Mrs. Browning. The prime thought in it is the sacrifice and pain that must go to make a poet of any genius.

> "The great god sighed for the cost and the pain."  </code></pre><p>What was he doing, the great god Pan,<br>Down in the reeds by the river?<br>Spreading ruin and scattering ban,<br>Splashing and paddling with hoofs of a goat,<br>And breaking the golden lilies afloat<br>With the dragon-fly on the river.</p></div> </div>
