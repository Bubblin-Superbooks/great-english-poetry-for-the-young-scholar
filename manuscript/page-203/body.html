Bright before it beat the water,  
Beat the clear and sunny water,  
Beat the shining Big-Sea-Water.  

There the wrinkled old Nokomis  
Nursed the little Hiawatha,  
Rocked him in his linden cradle,  
Bedded soft in moss and rushes,  
Safely bound with reindeer sinews;  
Stilled his fretful wail by saying,  
"Hush! the Naked Bear will hear thee!"  
Lulled him into slumber, singing,  
"Ewa-yea! my little owlet!  
Who is this that lights the wigwam?  
With his great eyes lights the wigwam?  
Ewa-yea! my little owlet!" </pre></div> </div>
