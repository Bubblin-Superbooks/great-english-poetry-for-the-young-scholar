When to her task the milkmaid goes,  
Soothingly calling,â€”  
"So, boss! so, boss! so! so! so!"  
The cheerful milkmaid takes her stool,  
And sits and milks in the twilight cool,  
Saying, "So! so, boss! so! so!"  

To supper at last the farmer goes.  
The apples are pared, the paper read,  
The stories are told, then all to bed.  
Without, the crickets' ceaseless song  
Makes shrill the silence all night long;  
The heavy dews are falling.  
The housewife's hand has turned the lock;  
Drowsily ticks the kitchen clock;  
The household sinks to deep repose;  
But still in sleep the farm-boy goes. </pre></div> </div>
