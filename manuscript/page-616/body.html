How can ye chant, ye little birds,  
And I sae fu' o' care.  

Thou'lt break my heart, thou bonnie bird  
That sings upon the bough;  
Thou minds me o' the happy days  
When my fause luve was true.  

Thou'lt break my heart, thou bonnie bird  
That sings beside thy mate;  
For sae I sat, and sae I sang,  
And wist na o' my fate.  

Aft hae I rov'd by bonnie Doon,  
To see the woodbine twine,  
And ilka bird sang o' its love,  
And sae did I o' mine. </pre></div> </div>
