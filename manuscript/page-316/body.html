The memory of her buried joys,  
And even she who gave thee birth,  
Will, by their pilgrim-circled hearth,  
Talk of thy doom without a sigh;  
For thou art Freedom's now, and Fame's:  
One of the few, the immortal names,  
That were not born to die.  </code></pre><p>-Fitz-greene Halleck.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
