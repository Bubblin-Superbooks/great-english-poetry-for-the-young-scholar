The flower will bloom another year.  
Weep no more! O, weep no more!  
Young buds sleep in the root's white core.  
Dry your eyes! Oh! dry your eyes!  
For I was taught in Paradise  
To ease my breast of melodies—  
Shed no tear.  

Overhead! look overhead!  
'Mong the blossoms white and red—  
Look up, look up. I flutter now  
On this flush pomegranate bough.  
See me! 'tis this silvery bell  
Ever cures the good man's ill.  
Shed no tear! O, shed no tear! </pre></div> </div>
