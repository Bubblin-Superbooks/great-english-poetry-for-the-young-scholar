And as a huntsman scours the brakes with sixteen brace of dogs,  
With two-and-thirty cannon the ship explored the fogs.  
From Cape la Hogue to Ushant, from Rochefort to Belleisle,  
She hunted game till reef and mud were rubbing on her keel.  

The fogs are dried, the frigate's side is bright with melting tar,  
The lad up in the foretop sees square white sails afar;  
The east wind drives three square-sailed masts from out the Breton bay,  
And "Clear for action!" Farmer shouts, and reefers yell "Hooray!" </pre></div> </div>
