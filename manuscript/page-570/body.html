Round veered the flapping sail,  
'Death!' was the helmsman's hail,  
'Death without quarter!'  
Midships with iron keel  
Struck we her ribs of steel;  
Down her black hulk did reel  
Through the black water!  

"As with his wings aslant,  
Sails the fierce cormorant,  
Seeking some rocky haunt,  
With his prey laden,  
So toward the open main,  
Beating to sea again,  
Through the wild hurricane,  
Bore I the maiden. </pre></div> </div>
