Let rocks their silence breakâ€”  
The sound prolong.  

Our fathers' God, to Thee,  
Author of liberty,  
To Thee we sing:  
Long may our land be bright  
With freedom's holy light:  
Protect us by Thy might,  
Great God, our King.  </code></pre><p>-S.F. Smith.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
