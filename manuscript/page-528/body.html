Her brow is like the snawdrift,  
Her throat is like the swan,  
Her face it is the fairest  
That e'er the sun shone on—  
That e'er the sun shone on;  
And dark blue is her e'e;  
And for bonnie Annie Laurie  
I'd lay me doune and dee.  

Like dew on the gowan lying  
Is the fa' o' her fairy feet;  
Like the winds in summer sighing,  
Her voice is low and sweet—  
Her voice is low and sweet;  
And she's a' the world to me;  
And for bonnie Annie Laurie </pre></div> </div>
