My form with indifference see;  
They are so unacquainted with man,  
Their tameness is shocking to me.  

Society, Friendship, and Love,  
Divinely bestow'd upon man,  
Oh, had I the wings of a dove,  
How soon would I taste you again!  
My sorrows I then might assuage  
In the ways of religion and truth,  
Might learn from the wisdom of age,  
And be cheer'd by the sallies of youth.  

Ye winds that have made me your sport,  
Convey to this desolate shore  
Some cordial endearing report  
Of a land I shall visit no more! </pre></div> </div>
