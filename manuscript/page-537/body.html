When a band of exiles moored their bark  
On the wild New England shore.  

Not as the conqueror comes,  
They, the true-hearted, came;  
Not with the roll of the stirring drums,  
And the trumpet that sings of fame.  

Not as the flying come,  
In silence and in fear;  
They shook the depths of the desert gloom  
With their hymns of lofty cheer.  

Amid the storm they sang,  
And the stars heard, and the sea,  
And the sounding aisles of the dim woods rang  
To the anthem of the free! </pre></div> </div>
