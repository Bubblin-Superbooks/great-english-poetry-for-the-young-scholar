Where the mowers mow the cleanest,  
Where the hay lies thick and greenest,  
There to trace the homeward bee,  
That's the way for Billy and me.  

Where the hazel bank is steepest,  
Where the shadow falls the deepest,  
Where the clustering nuts fall free.  
That's the way for Billy and me.  

Why the boys should drive away,  
Little sweet maidens from the play,  
Or love to banter and fight so well,  
That's the thing I never could tell.  

But this I know, I love to play, </pre></div> </div>
