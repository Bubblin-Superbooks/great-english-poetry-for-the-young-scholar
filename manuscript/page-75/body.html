Now dash away! dash away! dash away all!"<br>As dry leaves that before the wild hurricane fly,<br>When they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky;<br>So up to the house-top the coursers they flew,<br>With the sleigh full of toys, and St. Nicholas, too.<br>And then, in a twinkling, I heard on the roof<br>The prancing and pawing of each little hoof.<br>As I drew in my head, and was turning around,<br>Down the chimney St. Nicholas came with a bound.<br>He was dressed all in fur, from his head to his foot,<br>And his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot;<br>A bundle of toys he had flung on his back,<br>And he looked like a peddler just opening his pack.<br>His eyesâ€”how they twinkled! his dimples how merry! </p></div> </div>
