Then out spake brave Horatius,  
The Captain of the Gate:  
"To every man upon this earth  
Death cometh soon or late;  
And how can man die better  
Than facing fearful odds,  
For the ashes of his fathers,  
And the temples of his gods.  

"And for the tender mother  
Who dandled him to rest,  
And for the wife who nurses  
His baby at her breast,  
And for the holy maidens  
Who feed the eternal flame,  
To save them from false Sextus </pre></div> </div>
