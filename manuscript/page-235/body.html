<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">
And cozie here, beneath the blast,  
Thou thought to dwell,  
Till, crash! the cruel coulter passed  
Out through thy cell.  

That wee bit heap o' leaves and stibble  
Has cost thee monie a weary nibble!  
Now thou's turned out for a' thy trouble,  
But house or hald,  
To thole the winter's sleety dribble,  
And cranreuch cauld!  

But, Mousie, thou art no thy lane,  
In proving foresight may be vain:  
The best-laid schemes o' mice and men  
Gang aft a-gley,  
And lea'e us naught but grief and pain, </pre></div> </div>
