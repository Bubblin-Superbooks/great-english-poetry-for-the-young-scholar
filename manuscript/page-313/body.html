With banquet-song, and dance, and wine;  
And thou art terrible—the tear,  
The groan, the knell, the pall, the bier,  
And all we know, or dream, or fear  
Of agony, are thine.  

But to the hero, when his sword  
Has won the battle for the free,  
Thy voice sounds like a prophet's word;  
And in its hollow tones are heard  
The thanks of millions yet to be.  
Come, when his task of fame is wrought—  
Come, with her laurel-leaf, blood-bought—  
Come in her crowning hour—and then  
Thy sunken eye's unearthly light  
To him is welcome as the sight  
Of sky and stars to prisoned men; </pre></div> </div>
