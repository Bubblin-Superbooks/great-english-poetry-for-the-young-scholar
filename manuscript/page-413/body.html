Three times his kingly beard he smoothed,  
And made him viceroy o'er his sheep.  

His words were simple words enough,  
And yet he used them so,  
That what in other mouths was rough  
In his seemed musical and low.  

Men called him but a shiftless youth,  
In whom no good they saw;  
And yet, unwittingly, in truth,  
They made his careless words their law.  

They knew not how he learned at all,  
For idly, hour by hour,  
He sat and watched the dead leaves fall,  
Or mused upon a common flower. </pre></div> </div>
