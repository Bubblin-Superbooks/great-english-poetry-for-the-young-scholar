<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">
Pretty and quiet, with plain brown wings,  
Passing at home a patient life,  
Broods in the grass while her husband sings,  
Bob-o'-link, bob-o'-link,  
Spink, spank, spink,  
Brood, kind creature, you need not fear  
Thieves and robbers while I am here.  
Chee, chee, chee.  

Modest and shy as a nun is she;  
One weak chirp is her only note;  
Braggart, and prince of braggarts is he,  
Pouring boasts from his little throat,  
Bob-o'-link, bob-o'-link,  
Spink, spank, spink,  
Never was I afraid of man,  
Catch me, cowardly knaves, if you can. </pre></div> </div>
