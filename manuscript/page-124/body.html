<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">his meals, I ween,<br>In his cell so lone and cold.<br>The walls must be crumbled, the stones decayed.<br>To pleasure his dainty whim;<br>And the mouldering dust that years have made<br>Is a merry meal for him.<br>Creeping where no life is seen,<br>A rare old plant is the ivy green.</p><p>Fast he stealeth on, though he wears no wings,<br>And a staunch old heart has he!  
How closely he twineth, how tight he clings<br>To his friend, the huge oak tree!  
And slyly he traileth along the ground,<br>And his leaves he gently waves,<br>And he joyously twines and hugs around<br>The rich mould of dead men's graves.<br>Creeping where no life is seen,<br>A rare old plant is the ivy green.</p></div> </div>
