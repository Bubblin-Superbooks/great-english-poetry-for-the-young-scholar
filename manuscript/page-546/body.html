That can brutish passion curb!  
Some do think its name should be  
Shield-Heart, White Integrity.  
Traveller, pluck a stem of moly,  
If thou touch at Circe's isle,â€”  
Hermes' moly, growing solely  
To undo enchanter's wile!  </code></pre><p>-Edith M. Thomas.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
