For the priest, and the bell, and the holy well;<br>For the wheel where I spun,<br>And the bless√®d light of the sun!"<br>And so she sings her fill,<br>Singing most joyfully,<br>Till the spindle drops from her hand,<br>And the whizzing wheel stands still.<br>She steals to the window, and looks at the sand,<br>And over the sand at the sea;<br>And her eyes are set in a stare;<br>And anon there breaks a sigh,<br>And anon there drops a tear,<br>From a sorrow-clouded eye,<br>And a heart sorrow-laden,<br>A long, long</p></div> </div>
