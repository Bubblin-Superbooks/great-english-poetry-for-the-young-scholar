Who slew the great wild boar,  
The great wild boar that had his den  
Amid the reeds of Cosa's fen.  
And wasted fields and slaughtered men  
Along Albinia's shore.  

Herminius smote down Aruns;  
Lartius laid Ocnus low;  
Right to the heart of Lausulus  
Horatius sent a blow.  
"Lie there," he cried, "fell pirate!  
No more, aghast and pale,  
From Ostia's walls the crowd shall mark  
The tracks of thy destroying bark,  
No more Campania's hinds shall fly  
To woods and caverns when they spy  
Thy thrice accurs√©d sail." </pre></div> </div>
