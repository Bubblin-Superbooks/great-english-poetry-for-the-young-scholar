Yet e'en those bones from insult to protect  
Some frail memorial still erected nigh,  
With uncouth rhimes and shapeless sculpture deck'd,  
Implores the passing tribute of a sigh.  

Their name, their years, spelt by th' unlettered Muse,  
The place of fame and elegy supply.  
And many a holy text around she strews  
That teach the rustic moralist to die.  

For who to dumb forgetfulness a prey,  
This pleasing anxious being e'er resigned,  
Left the warm precincts of the cheerful day,  
Nor cast one longing, ling'ring look behind?  

On some fond breast the parting soul relies, </pre></div> </div>
