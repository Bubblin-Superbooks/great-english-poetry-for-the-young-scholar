<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>The charm√®d sunset linger'd low adown<br>In the red West: thro' mountain clefts the dale<br>Was seen far inland, and the yellow down<br>Border'd with palm, and many a winding vale<br>And meadow, set with slender galingale;<br>A land where all things always seem'd the same!  
And round about the keel with faces pale,<br>Dark faces pale against that rosy flame,<br>The mild-eyed melancholy Lotos-eaters came.</p><p>Branches they bore of that enchanted stem,<br>Laden with flower and fruit, whereof they gave<br>To each, but whoso did receive of them,<br>And taste, to him the gushing of the wave<br>Far, far away did seem to mourn and rave<br>On alien shores; and if his fellow spake,<br>His voice was thin, as voices from the grave;<br>And deep-asleep he seem'd, yet all awake,<br>And music in his ears his beating heart did make.</p></div> </div>
