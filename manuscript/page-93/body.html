<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">_Vixen_!  
On, _Comet_! on, _Cupid_! on, _Donder_ and _Blitzen_!  
To the top of the porch! to the top of the wall!  
Now dash away! dash away! dash away all!"  
As dry leaves that before the wild hurricane fly,  
When they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky;  
So up to the house-top the coursers they flew,  
With the sleigh full of toys, and St. Nicholas, too.  
And then, in a twinkling, I heard on the roof  
The prancing and pawing of each little hoof.  
As I drew in my head, and was turning around,  
Down the chimney St. Nicholas came with a bound.  
He was dressed all in fur, from his head to his foot,  
And his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot;  
A bundle of toys he had flung on his back,  
And he looked like a peddler just opening his pack.  
His eyesâ€”how they twinkled! his dimples how merry! </pre></div> </div>
