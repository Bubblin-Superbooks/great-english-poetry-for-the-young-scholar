And, like a dam, the mighty wreck  
Lay right athwart the stream;  
And a long shout of triumph  
Rose from the walls of Rome,  
As to the highest turret tops  
Was splashed the yellow foam.  

And, like a horse unbroken  
When first he feels the rein,  
The furious river struggled hard,  
And tossed his tawny mane;  
And burst the curb, and bounded,  
Rejoicing to be free,  
And whirling down, in fierce career,  
Battlement, and plank, and pier,  
Rushed headlong to the sea. </pre></div> </div>
