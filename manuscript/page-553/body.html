This sea, that bares her bosom to the moon,<br>The winds that will be howling at all hours,<br>And are up-gathered now like sleeping flowersâ€”<br>For this, for everything, we are out of tune;<br>It moves us not. Great God! I'd rather be<br>A pagan, suckled in a creed outworn,<br>So might I, standing on this pleasant lea,<br>Have glimpses that would make me less forlorn;<br>Have sight of Proteus, rising from the sea,<br>Or hear old Triton blow his wreathed horn.</p></div> </div>
