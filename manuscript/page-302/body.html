When one boy learns it the others want to follow. It takes as a hero the man who gives common service—the one who does not lead or command, but follows the line of duty. (1865-.)</p><pre class="  "><code>In the name of the Empress of India, make way,  
O Lords of the Jungle wherever you roam,  
The woods are astir at the close of the day—  
We exiles are waiting for letters from Home—  
Let the robber retreat; let the tiger turn tail,  
In the name of the Empress the Overland-Mail! </pre></div> </div>
