These purple sands at low tide stretch off into the sea miles away, and are said to be full of quicksands.</p><pre class="  "><code>"O Mary, go and call the cattle home,  
And call the cattle home,  
And call the cattle home,  
Across the sands of Dee."  
The western wind was wild and dark with foam  
And all alone went she. </pre></div> </div>
