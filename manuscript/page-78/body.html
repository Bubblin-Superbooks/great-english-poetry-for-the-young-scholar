Thunder, "Cut away the mast!"  

So we shuddered there in silence,â€”  
For the stoutest held his breath,  
While the hungry sea was roaring  
And the breakers talked with Death.  

As thus we sat in darkness,  
Each one busy with his prayers,  
"We are lost!" the captain shouted  
As he staggered down the stairs.  

But his little daughter whispered,  
As she took his icy hand,  
"Isn't God upon the ocean,  
Just the same as on the land?" </pre></div> </div>
