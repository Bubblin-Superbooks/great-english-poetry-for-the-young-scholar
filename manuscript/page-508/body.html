Trust no Future, howe'er pleasant!  
Let the dead Past bury its dead!  
Act,â€”act in the living Present!  
Heart within, and God o'erhead!  

Lives of great men all remind us  
We can make our lives sublime,  
And, departing, leave behind us  
Footprints on the sands of time;  

Footprints, that perhaps another,  
Sailing o'er life's solemn main,  
A forlorn and shipwrecked brother,  
Seeing, shall take heart again.  

Let us, then, be up and doing, </pre></div> </div>
