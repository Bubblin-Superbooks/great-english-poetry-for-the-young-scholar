<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">
And charge with all thy chivalry!  

Few, few shall part, where many meet!  
The snow shall be their winding-sheet,  
And every turf beneath their feet  
Shall be a soldier's sepulcher.  </code></pre><p>-Thomas Campbell.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
