But the gingham dog and the calico cat  
Wallowed this way and tumbled that,  
Employing every tooth and claw  
In the awfullest way you ever sawâ€”  
And, oh! how the gingham and calico flew!  
(_Don't fancy I exaggerate!_  
_I got my views from the Chinese plate!_       ) 

Next morning where the two had sat  
They found no trace of the dog or cat;  
And some folks think unto this day  
That burglars stole the pair away!  
But the truth about the cat and the pup  
Is this: They ate each other up!  
Now what do you really think of that!  
(_The old Dutch clock it told me so,_  
_And that is how I came to know_.       )
