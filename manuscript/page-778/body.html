"I have wrenched it free from the halliard to hang for a wisp on the Horn;  
I have chased it north to the Lizardâ€”ribboned and rolled and torn;  
I have spread its fold o'er the dying, adrift in a hopeless sea;  
I have hurled it swift on the slaver, and seen the slave set free.  

"My basking sunfish know it, and wheeling albatross,  
Where the lone wave fills with fire beneath the Southern Cross.  
What is the Flag of England? Ye have but my reefs to dare,  
Ye have but my seas to furrow. Go forth, for it is there!" </pre></div> </div>
