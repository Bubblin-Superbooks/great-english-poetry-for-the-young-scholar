And share my meal, a welcome guest.  

Around my ivied porch shall spring  
Each fragrant flower that drinks the dew;  
And Lucy, at her wheel, shall sing  
In russet gown and apron blue.  

The village church among the trees,  
Where first our marriage-vows were given,  
With merry peals shall swell the breeze  
And point with taper spire to Heaven. </code></pre><p>-S. Rogers.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
