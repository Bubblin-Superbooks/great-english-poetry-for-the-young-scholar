From Winchester down to save the day!"  

Hurrah! hurrah for Sheridan!  
Hurrah! hurrah for horse and man!  
And when their statues are placed on high,  
Under the dome of the Union sky,  
The American soldiers' Temple of Fame,  
There with the glorious General's name  
Be it said, in letters both bold and bright:  
"Here is the steed that saved the day,  
By carrying Sheridan into the fight  
From Winchester, twenty miles away!"  </code></pre><p>-Thomas Buchanan Read.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
