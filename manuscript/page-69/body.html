He's gone to fight the French for King George upon the throne;  
And it's oh! in my heart how I wish him safe at home.  

Oh where! and oh where! does your Highland laddie dwell?  
He dwells in merry Scotland at the sign of the Bluebell;  
And it's oh! in my heart that I love my laddie well.  </code></pre><hr class="section"></div> </div>
