<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="  "><code>Grow old along with me!  
The best is yet to be,  
The last of life, for which the first was made:  
Our times are in His hand  
Who saith, "A whole I plann'd,  
Youth shows but half; trust God: see all nor be afraid!"  

Not that, amassing flowers,  
Youth sigh'd, "Which rose make ours,  
Which lily leave and then as best recall?"  
Not that, admiring stars,  
It yearn'd, "Nor Jove, nor Mars;  
Mine be some figured flame which blends, transcends them all!"  

Not for such hopes and fears  
Annulling youth's brief years,  
Do I remonstrate: folly wide the mark! </pre></div> </div>
