"Make way for liberty!" he cried.  
Their keen points crossed from side to side;  
He bowed amidst them like a tree,  
And thus made way for liberty.  

Swift to the breach his comrades fly,  
"Make way for liberty!" they cry,  
And through the Austrian phalanx dart,  
As rushed the spears through Arnold's heart.  
While instantaneous as his fall,  
Rout, ruin, panic, seized them all;  
An earthquake could not overthrow  
A city with a surer blow.  

Thus Switzerland again was free;  
Thus Death made way for Liberty! </code></pre><p>-James Montgomery.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
