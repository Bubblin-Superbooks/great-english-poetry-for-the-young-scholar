Very carefully and slow,  
Men of Bideford in Devon,  
And we laid them on the ballast down below;  
For we brought them all aboard,  
And they blest him in their pain that they were not left to Spain,  
To the thumbscrew and the stake, for the glory of the Lord.  

He had only a hundred seamen to work the ship and to fight,  
And he sail'd away from Flores till the Spaniard came in sight,  
With his huge sea-castles heaving upon the weather bow.  
"Shall we fight or shall we fly?  
Good Sir Richard, tell us now, </pre></div> </div>
