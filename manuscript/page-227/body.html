How the boys and girls loved it! The author, J. T. Trowbridge (1827-still living), "is a boy-hearted man," says John Burroughs. The poem is just as popular as it ever was.</p><pre class="  "><code>Over the hill the farm-boy goes,  
His shadow lengthens along the land,  
A giant staff in a giant hand;  
In the poplar-tree, above the spring,  
The katydid begins to sing;  
The early dews are falling;â€”  
Into the stone-heap darts the mink; </pre></div> </div>
