Make way for liberty, and died.  
In arms the Austrian phalanx stood,  
A living wall, a human wood,â€”  
A wall, where every conscious stone  
Seemed to its kindred thousands grown.  
A rampart all assaults to bear,  
Till time to dust their frames should wear;  
So still, so dense the Austrians stood,  
A living wall, a human wood.  

Impregnable their front appears,  
All horrent with projected spears.  
Whose polished points before them shine,  
From flank to flank, one brilliant line,  
Bright as the breakers' splendours run </pre></div> </div>
