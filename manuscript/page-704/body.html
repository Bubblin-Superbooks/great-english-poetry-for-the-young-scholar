<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre><code>The world is too much with us; late and soon,  
Getting and spending, we lay waste our powers;  
Little we see in Nature that is ours.  
We have given our hearts away, a sordid boon!  
This sea, that bares her bosom to the moon,  
The winds that will be howling at all hours,  
And are up-gathered now like sleeping flowersâ€”  
For this, for everything, we are out of tune;  
It moves us not. Great God! I'd rather be  
A pagan, suckled in a creed outworn,  
So might I, standing on this pleasant lea,  
Have glimpses that would make me less forlorn;  
Have sight of Proteus, rising from the sea,  
Or hear old Triton blow his wreathed horn. </code></pre><p>-William Wordsworth.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
