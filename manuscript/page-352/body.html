They hear no sound; the swell is strong;  
Though the wind hath fallen, they drift along  
Till the vessel strikes with a shivering shock:  
"O Christ! it is the Inchcape Rock!"  

Sir Ralph the Rover tore his hair,  
He curst himself in his despair:  
The waves rush in on every side,  
The ship is sinking beneath the tide.  

But, even in his dying fear,  
One dreadful sound could the Rover hear,â€”  
A sound as if with the Inchcape Bell  
The Devil below was ringing his knell.  </code></pre><p>-Robert Southey.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
