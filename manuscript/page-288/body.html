After the field was won;  
For many thousand bodies here  
Lay rotting in the sun.  
But things like that, you know, must be  
After a famous victory.  

"Great praise the Duke of Marlborough won,  
And our good Prince Eugene."  
"Why, 'twas a very wicked thing!"  
Said little Wilhelmine.  
"Nay, nay, my little girl," quoth he,  
"It was a famous victory!  

"And everybody praised the Duke  
Who this great fight did win."  
"But what good came of it at last?"  
Quoth little Peterkin. </pre></div> </div>
