You've swallowed Caird completely  
And psychologic Ladd.  
Rosmini you've digested,  
And Kant in rags you've clad.  

Gnaw on, my elfish rodent!  
Lay all the sages low!  
My pretty lace and ribbons,  
They're yours for weal or woe!  
My pocket-book's in tatters  
Because you like it so.  </code></pre><p>-Mary E. Burt.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
