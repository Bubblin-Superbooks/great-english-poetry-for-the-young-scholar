<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">played.<br>My mother kissed me here;<br>My father pressed my handâ€”<br>Forgive this foolish tear,<br>But let that old oak stand.</p><p>My heart-strings round thee cling,<br>Close as thy bark, old friend!  
Here shall the wild-bird sing,<br>And still thy branches bend.<br>Old tree! the storm still brave!  
And, woodman, leave the spot;<br>While I've a hand to save,<br>Thy ax shall harm it not.</p><pre class="  "><code>
