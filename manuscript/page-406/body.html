From the right and the left, from behind and before,  
And all at once to the Bishop they go.  

They have whetted their teeth against the stones;  
And now they pick the Bishop's bones:  
They gnawed the flesh from every limb;  
For they were sent to do judgment on him!  </code></pre><p>-Robert Southey.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
