He turned them into the river lane;  
One after another he let them pass,  
Then fastened the meadow bars again.  

Under the willows and over the hill,  
He patiently followed their sober pace;  
The merry whistle for once was still,  
And something shadowed the sunny face.  

Only a boy! and his father had said  
He never could let his youngest go:  
Two already were lying dead,  
Under the feet of the trampling foe. </pre></div> </div>
