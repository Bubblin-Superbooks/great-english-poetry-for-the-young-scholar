<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h3>The Flag Goes By.</h3><p class="  start-chapter">"The Flag Goes By" is included out of regard to a boy of eleven years who pleased me by his great appreciation of it. It teaches the lesson of reverence to our great national symbol. It is published by permission of the author, Henry Holcomb Bennett, of Ohio. (1863-.)</p><pre class="  "><code>Hats off!  
Along the street there comes  
A blare of bugles, a ruffle of drums,  
A flash of colour beneath the sky:  
Hats off!  
The flag is passing by! </pre></div> </div>
