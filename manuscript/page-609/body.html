Children dear, was it yesterday?  

Children dear, were we long alone?  
"The sea grows stormy, the little ones moan;  
Long prayers," I said, "in the world they say;  
Come!" I said; and we rose through the surf in the bay.  
We went up the beach, by the sandy down  
Where the sea-stocks bloom, to the white-wall'd town;  
Through the narrow pav'd streets, where all was still,  
To the little gray church on the windy hill.  
From the church came a murmur of folk at their prayers,  
But we stood without in the cold blowing airs.  
We climb'd on the graves, on the stones worn with rains,  
And we gaz'd up the aisle through the small leaded panes. </pre></div> </div>
