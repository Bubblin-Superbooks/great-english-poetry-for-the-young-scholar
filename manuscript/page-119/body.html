<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">
Legs wide, arms lock'd behind,  
As if to balance the prone brow  
Oppressive with its mind.  

Just as perhaps he mus'd "My plans  
That soar, to earth may fall,  
Let once my army leader Lannes  
Waver at yonder wall,"—  
Out 'twixt the battery smokes there flew  
A rider, bound on bound  
Full-galloping; nor bridle drew  
Until he reach'd the mound.  

Then off there flung in smiling joy,  
And held himself erect  
By just his horse's mane, a boy:  
You hardly could suspect— </pre></div> </div>
