<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">wheel'd universe.  
And I say to any man or woman, "Let your soul stand cool and composed before a million universes."  

I see something of God each hour of the twenty-four, and each moment then,  
In the faces of men and women I see God, and in my own face in the glass,  
I find letters from God dropt in the street, and every one is sign'd by God's name,  
And I leave them where they are, for I know that wheresoe'er I go,  
Others will punctually come forever and ever.  

Listener up there! What have you to confide in me?  
Look in my face while I snuff the sidle of evening.  
(Talk honestly, no one else hears you, and I stay only a minute longer.       )</pre></div> </div>
