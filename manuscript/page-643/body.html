Blinding sweet, O great god Pan!  
The sun on the hill forgot to die,  
And the lilies reviv'd, and the dragon-fly  
Came back to dream on the river.  

Yet half a beast is the great god Pan,  
To laugh as he sits by the river,  
Making a poet out of a man:  
The true gods sigh for the cost and pain,â€”  
For the reed which grows nevermore again  
As a reed with the reeds in the river. </code></pre><p>-Elizabeth Barrett Browning.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
