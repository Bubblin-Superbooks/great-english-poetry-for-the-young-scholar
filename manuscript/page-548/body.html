By the wings I picked him up  
Like a bee, and in a cup  
Of my wine I plunged and sank him,  
Then what d'ye think I did?â€”I drank him.  
Faith, I thought him dead. Not he!  
There he lives with tenfold glee;  
And now this moment with his wings  
I feel him tickling my heart-strings.  </code></pre><p>-Leigh Hunt.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
