### A Fragment from Mark Antony's Speech.
</code></pre><p>This was the noblest Roman of them all:<br>All the conspirators, save only he,<br>Did that they did in envy of great CÃ¦sar;<br>He only, in a general honest thought<br>And common good to all, made one of them.<br>His life was gentle; and the elements<br>So mix'd in him, that Nature might stand up,<br>And say to all the world, "This was a man!"</p><pre class="  "><code>
