<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">run?—  
Since 'tis ask and have, I may—  
Since the others go ashore—  
Come! A good whole holiday!  
Leave to go and see my wife, whom I call the Belle Aurore!"  
That he asked and that he got,—nothing more.  

Name and deed alike are lost:  
Not a pillar nor a post  
In his Croisic keeps alive the feat as it befell;  
Not a head in white and black  
On a single fishing smack,  
In memory of the man but for whom had gone to wrack  
All that France saved from the fight whence England bore the bell.  
Go to Paris: rank on rank </pre></div> </div>
