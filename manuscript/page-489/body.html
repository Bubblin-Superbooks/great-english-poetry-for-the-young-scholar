They saw his crest appear,  
All Rome sent forth a rapturous cry,  
And even the ranks of Tuscany  
Could scarce forbear to cheer.  

And fiercely ran the current,  
Swollen high by months of rain;  
And fast his blood was flowing,  
And he was sore in pain,  
And heavy with his armour,  
And spent with changing blows:  
And oft they thought him sinking,  
But still again he rose.  

Never, I ween, did swimmer,  
In such an evil case,  
Struggle through such a raging flood </pre></div> </div>
