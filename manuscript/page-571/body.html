"Three weeks we westward bore,  
And when the storm was o'er,  
Cloud-like we saw the shore  
Stretching to leeward;  
There for my lady's bower  
Built I the lofty tower  
Which to this very hour  
Stands looking seaward.  

"There lived we many years;  
Time dried the maiden's tears;  
She had forgot her fears,  
She was a mother;  
Death closed her mild blue eyes;  
Under that tower she lies;  
Ne'er shall the sun arise </pre></div> </div>
