The East Wind roared:—"From the Kuriles, the Bitter Seas, I come,  
And me men call the Home-Wind, for I bring the English home.  
Look—look well to your shipping! By the breath of my mad typhoon  
I swept your close-packed Praya and beached your best at Kowloon!  

"The reeling junks behind me and the racing seas before,  
I raped your richest roadstead—I plundered Singapore!  
I set my hand on the Hoogli; as a hooded snake she rose,  
And I flung your stoutest steamers to roost with the startled crows. </pre></div> </div>
