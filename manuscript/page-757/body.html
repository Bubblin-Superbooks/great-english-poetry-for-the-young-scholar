Are you bought by English gold? Is it love the lying's for?  
Morn and eve, night and day.  
Have I piloted your bay,  
Entered free and anchored fast at the foot of Solidor.  
Burn the fleet and ruin France? That were worse than fifty Hogues!  
Sirs, they know I speak the truth! Sirs, believe me there's a way!  
Only let me lead the line,  
Have the biggest ship to steer,  
Get this _Formidable_ clear,  
Make the others follow mine,  
And I lead them, most and least, by a passage I know well,  
Right to Solidor past Gr√®ve,  
And there lay them safe and sound; </pre></div> </div>
