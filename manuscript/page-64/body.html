Appeared to know as sure as fate  
There was going to be a terrible spat.  
(_I wasn't there; I simply state_  
_What was told to me by the Chinese plate!_       ) 

The gingham dog went "bow-wow-wow!"  
And the calico cat replied "mee-ow!"  
The air was littered, an hour or so,  
With bits of gingham and calico,  
While the old Dutch clock in the chimney-place  
Up with its hands before its face,  
For it always dreaded a family row!  
(_Now mind: I'm only telling you_  
_What the old Dutch clock declares is true!_       ) 

The Chinese plate looked very blue,  
And wailed, "Oh, dear! what shall we do!" </pre></div> </div>
