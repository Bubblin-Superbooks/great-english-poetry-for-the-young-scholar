<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">gone<br>In the air<br>Nowhere<br>Was a moonbeam bare;<br>Far off and harmless the shy stars shone—<br>Sure and certain the Moon was gone!</p><p>The Wind he took to his revels once more;<br>On down,<br>In town,<br>Like a merry-mad clown,<br>He leaped and hallooed with whistle and roar—<br>"What's that?" The glimmering thread once more!</p><p>He flew in a rage—he danced and blew;<br>But in vain<br>Was the pain<br>Of his bursting brain;<br>For still the broader the Moon-scrap grew,<br>The broader he swelled his big cheeks and blew.</p></div> </div>
