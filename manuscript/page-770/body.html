<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h3>To America.</h3><p class="  start-chapter">"To America," included by permission of the Poet Laureate, is a good poem and a great poem. It is a keen thrust at the common practice of teaching American children to hate the English of these days on account of the actions of a silly old king dead a hundred years. Alfred Austin deserves great credit for this poem.</p><pre class="  "><code>What is the voice I hear  
On the winds of the western sea?  
Sentinel, listen from out Cape Clear  
And say what the voice may be.  
'Tis a proud free people calling loud to a people proud and free. </pre></div> </div>
