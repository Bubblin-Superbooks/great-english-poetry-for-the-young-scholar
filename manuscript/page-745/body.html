The child that a mother attended and loved,  
The mother that infant's affection that proved,  
The husband that mother and infant that blessed,  
Each, all, are away to their dwelling of rest.  

The maid on whose cheek, on whose brow, in whose eye,  
Shone beauty and pleasure,â€”her triumphs are by;  
And the memory of those that beloved her and praised  
Are alike from the minds of the living erased.  

The hand of the king that the scepter hath borne,  
The brow of the priest that the miter hath worn,  
The eye of the sage, and the heart of the brave,  
Are hidden and lost in the depths of the grave. </pre></div> </div>
