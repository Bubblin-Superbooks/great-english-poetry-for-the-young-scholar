Who gives, than of His tribes that take, I must believe.  

Then, welcome each rebuff  
That turns earth's smoothness rough,  
Each sting, that bids nor sit nor stand, but go!  
Be our joys three parts pain!  
Strive, and hold cheap the strain;  
Learn, nor account the pang; dare, never grudge the throe!  

For thence,—a paradox  
Which comforts while it mocks,—  
Shall life succeed in that it seems to fail:  
What I aspired to be,  
And was not, comforts me:  
A brute I might have been, but would not sink i' the scale. </pre></div> </div>
