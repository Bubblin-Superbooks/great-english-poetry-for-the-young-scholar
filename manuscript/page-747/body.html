We drink the same stream, and we feel the same sun,  
And we run the same course that our fathers have run.  

The thoughts we are thinking, our fathers would think;  
From the death we are shrinking from, they too would shrink;  
To the life we are clinging to, they too would cling;

They scorned, but the heart of the haughty is cold;

They enjoyed, but the voice of their gladness is dumb.  

They died, ay! they died! and we things that are now, </pre></div> </div>
