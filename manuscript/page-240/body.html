Unskilful he to note the card  
Of prudent lore,  
Till billows rage, and gales blow hard,  
And whelm him o'er!  

Such fate to suffering worth is given,  
Who long with wants and woes has striven,  
By human pride or cunning driven  
To misery's brink,  
Till wrenched of every stay but Heaven,  
He, ruined, sink!  

Even thou who mourn'st the Daisy's fate,  
That fate is thineâ€”no distant date;  
Stern Ruin's plowshare drives, elate,  
Full on thy bloom,  
Till crushed beneath the furrow's weight </pre></div> </div>
