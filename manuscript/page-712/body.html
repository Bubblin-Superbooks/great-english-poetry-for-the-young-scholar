The moping owl does to the moon complain  
Of such as, wandering near her secret bow'r,  
Molest her ancient solitary reign.  

Beneath those rugged elms, that yew-tree's shade,  
Where heaves the turf in many a mould'ring heap,  
Each in his narrow cell forever laid,  
The rude Forefathers of the hamlet sleep.  

The breezy call of incense-breathing morn,  
The swallow twitt'ring from the straw-built shed,  
The cock's shrill clarion, or the echoing horn,  
No more shall rouse them from their lowly bed.  

For them no more the blazing hearth shall burn,  
Or busy housewife ply her evening care:  
No children run to lisp their sire's return, </pre></div> </div>
