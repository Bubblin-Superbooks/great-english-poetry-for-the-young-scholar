<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h3>I Remember, I Remember.</h3><pre class="  "><code>I remember, I remember  
The house where I was born,  
The little window where the sun  
Came peeping in at morn;  
He never came a wink too soon  
Nor brought too long a day;  
But now, I often wish the night  
Had borne my breath away.  

I remember, I remember  
The roses, red and white,  
The violets, and the lily-cupsâ€”  
Those flowers made of light!  
The lilacs where the robin built, </pre></div> </div>
