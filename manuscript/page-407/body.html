### Abide With Me.

"Abide With Me" (Henry Francis Lyte, 1793-1847 appeals to our natural longing for the unchanging and to our love of security.   ) 
</code></pre><p>Abide with me! fast falls the eventide;<br>The darkness deepens; Lord, with me abide!  
When other helpers fail, and comforts flee,<br>Help of the helpless, O abide with me.</p><p>Swift to its close ebbs out life's little day;<br>Earth's joys grow dim, its glories pass away;<br>Change and decay in all around I see:<br>O Thou who changest not, abide with me!</p></div> </div>
