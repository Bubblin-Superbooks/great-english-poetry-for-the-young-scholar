All souls were saved at last.  

Sail on, _Three Bells_, forever,  
In grateful memory sail!  
Ring on, _Three Bells_ of rescue,  
Above the wave and gale!  

Type of the Love eternal,  
Repeat the Master's cry,  
As tossing through our darkness  
The lights of God draw nigh!  </code></pre><p>-John G. Whittier.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
