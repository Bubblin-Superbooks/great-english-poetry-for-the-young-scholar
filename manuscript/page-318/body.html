That life had nearly perished.  

They knew by his awful and kingly look,  
By the order hastily spoken,  
That he dreamed of days when the nations shook,  
And the nations' hosts were broken.  

He dreamed that the Frenchman's sword still slew,  
And triumphed the Frenchman's eagle,  
And the struggling Austrian fled anew,  
Like the hare before the beagle.  

The bearded Russian he scourged again,  
The Prussian's camp was routed,  
And again on the hills of haughty Spain  
His mighty armies shouted. </pre></div> </div>
