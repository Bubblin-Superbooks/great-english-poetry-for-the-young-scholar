<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">prayers,<br>But we stood without in the cold blowing airs.<br>We climb'd on the graves, on the stones worn with rains,<br>And we gaz'd up the aisle through the small leaded panes.<br>She sate by the pillar; we saw her clear:<br>"Margaret, hist! come quick, we are here!  
Dear heart," I said, "we are long alone;<br>The sea grows stormy, the little ones moan."<br>But, ah, she gave me never a look,<br>For her eyes were seal'd to the holy book!  
Loud prays the priest: shut stands the door.<br>Come away, children, call no more!  
Come away, come down, call no more!</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Down, down, down!  
Down to the depths of the sea!  
She sits at her wheel in the humming town,<br>Singing most</p></div> </div>
