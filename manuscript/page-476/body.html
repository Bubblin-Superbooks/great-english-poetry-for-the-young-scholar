The fortress of Nequinum lowers  
O'er the pale waves of Nar.  

Stout Lartius hurled down Aunus  
Into the stream beneath;  
Herminius struck at Seius,  
And clove him to the teeth;  
At Picus brave Horatius  
Darted one fiery thrust;  
And the proud Umbrian's gilded arms  
Clashed in the bloody dust.  

Then Ocnus of Falerii  
Rushed on the Roman Three;  
And Lausulus of Urgo,  
The rover of the sea;  
And Aruns of Volsinium, </pre></div> </div>
