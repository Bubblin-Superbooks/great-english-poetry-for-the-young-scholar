<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h3>Old Folks At Home.</h3><pre class="  "><code>Way down upon de Swanee Ribber,  
Far, far away,  
Dere's wha my heart is turning ebber,  
Dere's wha de old folks stay.  
All up and down de whole creation  
Sadly I roam,  
Still longing for de old plantation,  
And for de old folks at home.  

All de world am sad and dreary,  
Eberywhere I roam;  
Oh, darkeys, how my heart grows weary,  
Far from de old folks at home!  

All round de little farm I wandered  
When I was young, </pre></div> </div>
