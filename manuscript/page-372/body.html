She had one bow-gun of a hundred ton,  
And a great stern-gun beside;  
They dipped their noses deep in the sea,  
They racked their stays and stanchions free  
In the wash of the wind-whipped tide.  

It was our war-ship _Clampherdown_,  
Fell in with a cruiser light  
That carried the dainty Hotchkiss gun  
And a pair o' heels wherewith to run,  
From the grip of a close-fought fight.  

She opened fire at seven miles—  
As ye shoot at a bobbing cork—  
And once she fired and twice she fired,  
Till the bow-gun drooped like a lily tired </pre></div> </div>
