This wee foot of the squirrel,  
And left a loving kiss.  

The tiny thief has hidden  
My candy and my plum;  
Ah, there he comes unbidden  
To gently nip my thumb,—  
Down in his home (my pocket   ) 

He gently nips my thumb.  

How strange the food he covets,  
The restless, restless wight;—  
Fred's old stuffed armadillo  
He found a tempting bite,  
Fred's old stuffed armadillo,  
With ears a perfect fright. </pre></div> </div>
