Then, pale and worn, he kept his deck,  
And thro' the darkness peered that night.  
Ah, darkest night! and then a speck,—  
A light! a light! a light! a light!  
It grew—a star-lit flag unfurled!  
It grew to be Time's burst of dawn;  
He gained a world! he gave that world  
Its watch-word: "On! and on!" </code></pre><p>-Joaquin Miller.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
