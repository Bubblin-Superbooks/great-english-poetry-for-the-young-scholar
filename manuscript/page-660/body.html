Tell wit how much it wrangles  
In tickle points of nicenesse;  
Tell wisdome she entangles  
Herselfe in over-wisenesse;  
And if they do reply,  
Straight give them both the lye.  

Tell physicke of her boldnesse;  
Tell skill it is pretension;  
Tell charity of coldnesse;  
Tell law it is contention;  
And as they yield reply,  
So give them still the lye.  

Tell fortune of her blindnesse;  
Tell nature of decay; </pre></div> </div>
