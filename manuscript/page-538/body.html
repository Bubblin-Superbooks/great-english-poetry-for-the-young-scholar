The ocean eagle soared  
From his nest by the white wave's foam;  
And the rocking pines of the forest roared,â€”  
This was their welcome home!  

There were men with hoary hair,  
Amid that pilgrim band;  
Why had _they_ come to wither there,  
Away from their childhood's land?  

There was woman's fearless eye,  
Lit by her deep love's truth;  
There was manhood's brow serenely high,  
And the fiery heart of youth.  

What sought they thus afar? </pre></div> </div>
