And where the lordly steeple shows.  
They sayde, "And why should this thing be?  
What danger lowers by land or sea?  
They ring the tune of Enderby!  

"For evil news from Mablethorpe,  
Of pyrate galleys warping down;  
For shippes ashore beyond the scorpe,

But while the west bin red to see,  
And storms be none, and pyrates flee,  
Why ring 'The Brides of Enderby'?"

Came riding downe with might and main;  
He rais'd a shout as he drew on,  
Till all the welkin rang again, </pre></div> </div>
