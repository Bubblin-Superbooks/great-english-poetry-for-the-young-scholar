Youth is for dispute and age for counsel; each year, each period of a man's life is but the necessary step to the next. Youth is an uncertain thing to bank on.</p><blockquote><p>"Grow old along with me!  
The best is yet to be,<br>The last of life for which the first was made."<br>"Rabbi Ben Ezra" is a plea for each period in life. Aspiration is the keynote.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>" ... Trust God; see all, nor be afraid!"  </p></blockquote></div> </div>
