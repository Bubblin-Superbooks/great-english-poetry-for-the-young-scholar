The cat's singin' gay thrums to the sleepin' hen,  
The doug's speldered on the floor, and disna gie a cheep;  
But here's a waukrife laddie that winna fa' asleep.  

Onything but sleep, ye rogue! glow'rin' like the moon,  
Rattlin' in an airn jug wi' an airn spoon,  
Rumblin' tumblin' roun' about, crowin' like a cock,  
Skirlin' like a kenna-what—wauknin' sleepin' folk.  

Hey, Willie Winkie! the wean's in a creel!  
Waumblin' aff a body's knee like a vera eel,  
Ruggin' at the cat's lug, and ravellin' a' her thrums,—  
Hey, Willie Winkie!—See, there he comes!  

Wearie is the mither that has a storie wean,  
A wee stumpie stoussie that canna rin his lane, </pre></div> </div>
