The poem puts his merry pranks to the front and prepares the way for science to give him a true analysis.</p><pre class="  "><code>The Frost looked forth, one still, clear night,  
And whispered, "Now I shall be out of sight;  
So through the valley and over the height,  
In silence I'll take my way:  
I will not go on with that blustering train,  
The wind and the snow, the hail and the rain,  
Who make so much bustle and noise in vain, </pre></div> </div>
