From strife, should know, than tempt  
Further. Thou waitedest age: wait death nor be afraid!  

Enough now, if the Right  
And Good and Infinite  
Be named here, as thou callest thy hand thine own,  
With knowledge absolute,  
Subject to no dispute  
From fools that crowded youth, nor let thee feel alone.  

Be there, for once and all,  
Sever'd great minds from small,  
Announced to each his station in the Past!  
Was I, the world arraigned,  
Were they, my soul disdain'd,  
Right? Let age speak the truth and give us peace at last! </pre></div> </div>
