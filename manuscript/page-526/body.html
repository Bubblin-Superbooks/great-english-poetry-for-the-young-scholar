<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">
Thy leaves o'er the bed  
Where thy mates of the garden  
Lie scentless and dead.  

So soon may I follow,  
When friendships decay,  
And from Love's shining circle  
The gems drop away.  
When true hearts lie withered,  
And fond ones are flown,  
O! who would inhabit  
This bleak world alone?  </code></pre><p>-Thomas Moore.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
