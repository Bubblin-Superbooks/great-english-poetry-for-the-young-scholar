Toward the reef of Norman's Woe.  

And ever the fitful gusts between  
A sound came from the land;  
It was the sound of the trampling surf  
On the rocks and the hard sea-sand.  

The breakers were right beneath her bows,  
She drifted a dreary wreck,  
And a whooping billow swept the crew  
Like icicles from her deck.  

She struck where the white and fleecy waves  
Looked soft as carded wool,  
But the cruel rocks they gored her side  
Like the horns of an angry bull. </pre></div> </div>
