Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."  

Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,  
Though its answer, little meaning, little relevancy bore;  
For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being  
Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber doorâ€”  
Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door  
With such a name as "Nevermore."

That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour;  
Nothing further then he uttered, not a feather then he</pre></div> </div>
