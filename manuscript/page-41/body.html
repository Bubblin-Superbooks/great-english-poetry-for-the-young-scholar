And scratches and won't attend.  
But Binkie will play whatever I choose,  
And he is my true First Friend.  

Pussy will rub my knees with her head,  
Pretending she loves me hard;  
But the very minute I go to my bed  
Pussy runs out in the yard.  

And there she stays till the morning light;  
So I know it is only pretend;  
But Binkie, he snores at my feet all night,  
And he is my Firstest Friend!  </code></pre><p>-Rudyard Kipling.</p><blockquote><p>(In "The Just So Stories.")</p></blockquote><hr class="section"></div> </div>
