It is included here out of respect to a boy of eleven years who was more impressed with these lines than with any other lines in any poem:</p><blockquote><p>"Like a poet hidden,<br>In the light of thought<br>Singing songs unbidden<br>Till the world is wrought<br>To sympathy with hopes and fears it heeded not."  </p></blockquote></div> </div>
