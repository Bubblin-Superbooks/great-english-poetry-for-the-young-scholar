An exile from Home, splendour dazzles in vain;  
O, give me my lowly thatched cottage again!  
The birds singing gaily, that came at my call,—  
Give me them,—and the peace of mind, dearer than all!  
Home! Home! sweet, sweet Home!  
There's no place like Home! there's no place like Home!  

How sweet 'tis to sit 'neath a fond father's smile,  
And the cares of a mother to soothe and beguile!  
Let others delight 'mid new pleasures to roam,  
But give me, oh, give me, the pleasures of Home!  
Home! Home! sweet, sweet Home!  
There's no place like Home! there's no place like Home!  

To thee I'll return, overburdened with care;  
The heart's dearest solace will smile on me there; </pre></div> </div>
