<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">fragment from "The Vision of Sir Launfal." It finds a place in this volume because it is the most perfect description of a charming day ever written.
</code></pre><p class=" stretch-last-line ">What is so rare as a day in June?<br>Then, if ever, come perfect days;<br>Then Heaven tries the earth if it be in tune,<br>And over it softly her warm ear lays:<br>Whether we look, or whether we listen,<br>We hear life murmur, or see it glisten;<br>Every clod feels a stir of might,<br>An instinct within it that reaches and towers,<br>And, groping blindly above it for light,<br>Climbs to a soul in grass and flowers;<br>The flush of life may well be seen<br>Thrilling back over hills and valleys;<br>The cowslip startles in meadows green.<br>The buttercup catches the sun in its chalice,<br>And there's never a leaf nor a blade too</p></div> </div>
