Oh, the pretty flowers,  
Coming ere the spring time,  
To tell of sunny hours.  
While the tree are leafless,  
While the fields are bare,  
Buttercups and daisies  
Spring up here and there.  

Ere the snowdrop peepeth,  
Ere the crocus bold,  
Ere the early primrose  
Opes its paly gold,  
Somewhere on the sunny bank  
Buttercups are bright;  
Somewhere 'mong the frozen grass </pre></div> </div>
