Blue and crimson and white it shines  
Over the steel-tipped, ordered lines.  
Hats off!  
The colours before us fly;  
But more than the flag is passing by.  

Sea-fights and land-fights, grim and great,  
Fought to make and to save the State:  
Weary marches and sinking ships;  
Cheers of victory on dying lips;  

Days of plenty and years of peace;  
March of a strong land's swift increase;  
Equal justice, right, and law,  
Stately honour and reverend awe; </pre></div> </div>
