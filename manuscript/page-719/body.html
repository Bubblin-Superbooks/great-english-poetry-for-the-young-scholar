And pore upon the brook that babbles by.  

"Hard by yon wood, now smiling as in scorn,  
Muttering his wayward fancies he would rove;  
Now drooping, woeful wan, like one forlorn,  
Or crazed with care, or crossed in hopeless love.  

"One morn I miss'd him on the custom'd hill,  
Along the heath, and near his favourite tree;  
Another came; nor yet beside the rill,  
Nor up the lawn, nor at the wood was he.  

"The next with dirges due in sad array  
Slow thro' the church-way path we saw him borne.  
Approach and read (for thou canst read the lay,       ) 

Graved on the stone beneath yon ag√®d thorn."  </code></pre><hr class="section"></div> </div>
