Children always love to learn it after hearing it read correctly and by one who understands and appreciates it. "Stand by" is the motto. My pupils teach it to me once a year and learn it themselves, too.</p><pre class="  "><code>Beneath the low-hung night cloud  
That raked her splintering mast  
The good ship settled slowly,  
The cruel leak gained fast. </pre></div> </div>
