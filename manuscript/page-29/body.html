### He Prayeth Best.

These two stanzas, the very heart of that great poem, "The Ancient Mariner," by Samuel Taylor Coleridge (1772-1834), sum up the lesson of this masterpieceâ€”"Insensibility is a crime."

He prayeth well who loveth well<br>Both man and bird and beast.</p><p>He prayeth best who loveth best<br>All things, both great and small:<br>For the dear God who loveth us,<br>He made and loveth all.</p></div> </div>
