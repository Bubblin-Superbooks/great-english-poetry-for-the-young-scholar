It is placed in this volume by permission of the poet, Jeremiah Eames Rankin, of Cleveland (1828-), because it captured the heart of a ten-year-old boy whose fancy was greatly moved by the two beautiful lines:</p><blockquote class="  "><p>"Her face is like an angel's face,<br>I'm glad she has no wings."  </p>
<pre><code>Nae shoon to hide her tiny taes,  
Nae stockin' on her feet; </blockquote></div> </div>
