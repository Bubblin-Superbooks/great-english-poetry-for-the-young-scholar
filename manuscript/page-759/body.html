See, safe through shoal and rock,  
How they follow in a flock,  
Not a ship that misbehaves, not a keel that grates the ground,  
Not a spar that comes to grief!  
The peril, see, is past,  
All are harboured to the last,  
And just as Hervé Riel hollas "Anchor!"—sure as fate,  
Up the English come—too late!  

So, the storm subsides to calm:  
They see the green trees wave  
On the heights o'erlooking Grève.  
Hearts that bled are stanched with balm,  
"Just our rapture to enhance,  
Let the English rake the bay,  
Gnash their teeth and glare askance </pre></div> </div>
