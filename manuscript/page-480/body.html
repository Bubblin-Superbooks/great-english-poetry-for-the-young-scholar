The blow, though turned, came yet too nigh;  
It missed his helm, but gashed his thigh:  
The Tuscans raised a joyful cry  
To see the red blood flow.  

He reeled, and on Herminius  
He leaned one breathing space;  
Then, like a wildcat mad with wounds,  
Sprang right at Astur's face.  
Through teeth, and skull, and helmet,  
So fierce a thrust he sped,  
The good sword stood a handbreadth out  
Behind the Tuscan's head.  

And the great Lord of Luna  
Fell at the deadly stroke,  
As falls on Mount Alvernus </pre></div> </div>
