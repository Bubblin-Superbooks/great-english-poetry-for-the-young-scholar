Drops so bright to see  
As from thy presence showers a rain of melody:â€”  

Like a poet hidden  
In the light of thought;  
Singing hymns unbidden,  
Till the world is wrought  
To sympathy with hopes and fears it heeded not.  

Teach us, sprite or bird,  
What sweet thoughts are thine:  
I have never heard  
Praise of love or wine  
That panted forth a flood of rapture so divine.  

Chorus hymeneal  
Or triumphal chaunt, </pre></div> </div>
