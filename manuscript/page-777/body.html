Ye have but my drifts to conquer. Go forth, for it is there!"  

The South Wind sighed:—"From The Virgins my mid-sea course was ta'en  
Over a thousand islands lost in an idle main,  
Where the sea-egg flames on the coral and the long-backed breakers croon  
Their endless ocean legends to the lazy, locked lagoon.  

"Strayed amid lonely islets, mazed amid outer keys,  
I waked the palms to laughter—I tossed the scud in the breeze—  
Never was isle so little, never was sea so lone,  
But over the scud and the palm-trees an English flag was flown. </pre></div> </div>
