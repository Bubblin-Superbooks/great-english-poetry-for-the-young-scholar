The poor little street-bred people that vapour and fume and brag,  
They are lifting their heads in the stillness to yelp at the English Flag!  

Must we borrow a clout from the Boer—to plaster anew with dirt?  
An Irish liar's bandage, or an English coward's shirt?  
We may not speak of England; her Flag's to sell or share.  
What is the Flag of England? Winds of the World, declare!  

The North Wind blew:—"From Bergen my steel-shod van-guards go;  
I chase your lazy whalers home from the Disko floe;  
By the great North Lights above me I work the will of God, </pre></div> </div>
