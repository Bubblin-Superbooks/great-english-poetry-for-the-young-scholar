He did not bring to view,  
Nor make a noise town-meeting days,  
As many people do.  

His worldly goods he never threw  
In trust to fortune's chances,  
But lived (as all his brothers do       ) 

In easy circumstances.  

Thus undisturbed by anxious cares  
His peaceful moments ran;  
And everybody said he was  
A fine old gentleman.  </code></pre><p>-Albert Gorton Greene.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
