The bless√®d homes of England!  
How softly on their bowers  
Is laid the holy quietness  
That breathes from Sabbath hours!  
Solemn, yet sweet, the church-bell's chime  
Floats through their woods at morn;  
All other sounds, in that still time,  
Of breeze and leaf are born.  

The cottage homes of England!  
By thousands on her plains,  
They are smiling o'er the silvery brooks,  
And round the hamlets' fanes.  
Through glowing orchards forth they peep,  
Each from its nook of leaves;  
And fearless there the lowly sleep, </pre></div> </div>
