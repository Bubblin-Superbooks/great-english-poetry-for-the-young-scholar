Love will make our cottage pleasant,  
And I love thee more than life."  

They by parks and lodges going  
See the lordly castles stand;  
Summer woods, about them blowing,  
Made a murmur in the land.  

From deep thought himself he rouses,  
Says to her that loves him well,  
"Let us see these handsome houses  
Where the wealthy nobles dwell."  

So she goes by him attended,  
Hears him lovingly converse,  
Sees whatever fair and splendid  
Lay betwixt his home and hers. </pre></div> </div>
