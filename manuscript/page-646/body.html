"Cusha! Cusha! Cusha!" calling,  
Ere the early dews were falling,  
Farre away I heard her song,  
"Cusha! Cusha!" all along;  
Where the reedy Lindis floweth,  
Floweth, floweth,  
From the meads where melick groweth  
Faintly came her milking songâ€”  

"Cusha! Cusha! Cusha!" calling,  
"For the dews will soone be falling;  
Leave your meadow grasses mellow,  
Mellow, mellow;  
Quit your cowslips, cowslips yellow;  
Come uppe, Whitefoot, come uppe, Lightfoot;  
Quit the stalks of parsley hollow, </pre></div> </div>
