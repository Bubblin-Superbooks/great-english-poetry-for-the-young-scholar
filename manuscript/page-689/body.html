Heroes in his own likeness grew,  
And warriors sprang from every sod,  
Which his awakening footstep trod.  

And now the work of life and death  
Hung on the passing of a breath;  
The fire of conflict burned within,  
The battle trembled to begin;  
Yet, while the Austrians held their ground,  
Point for attack was nowhere found;  
Where'er the impatient Switzers gazed,  
The unbroken line of lances blazed;  
That line 'twere suicide to meet,  
And perish at their tyrant's feet;  
How could they rest within their graves,  
And leave their homes, the homes of slaves!  
Would not they feel their children tread, </pre></div> </div>
