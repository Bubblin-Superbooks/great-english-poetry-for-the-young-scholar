We have a good specimen of a barnacle, and the children see them on the shells on the coast. The ethical point is invaluable.</p><pre class="  "><code>My soul is sailing through the sea,  
But the Past is heavy and hindereth me.  
The Past hath crusted cumbrous shells  
That hold the flesh of cold sea-mells  
About my soul.  
The huge waves wash, the high waves roll,  
Each barnacle clingeth and worketh dole </pre></div> </div>
