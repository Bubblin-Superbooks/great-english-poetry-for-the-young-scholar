<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h3>The Tournament.</h3><p class="  start-chapter">There are several of Sidney Lanier's (1842-81 poems that children love to learn. "Tampa Robins," "The Tournament" (Joust 1.), "Barnacles," "The Song of the Chattahoochee," and "The First Steamboat Up the Alabama" are among them. At our "poetry contests" the children have plainly demonstrated that this great poet has reached his hand down to the youngest. The time will doubtless come when it will be a part of education to be acquainted with Lanier, as it is now to be acquainted with Longfellow or Tennyson.   )</p><blockquote><p>I.</p></blockquote></div> </div>
