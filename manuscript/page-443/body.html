The poem is of the great body of world-lore. Southey (1774-1843).</p><pre class="  "><code>A well there is in the west country,  
And a clearer one never was seen;  
There is not a wife in the west-country  
But has heard of the Well of St. Keyne.  

An oak and an elm tree stand beside,  
And behind does an ash tree grow,  
And a willow from the bank above  
Droops to the water below. </pre></div> </div>
