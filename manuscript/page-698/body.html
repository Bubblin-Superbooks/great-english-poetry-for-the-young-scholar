All the conspirators, save only he,  
Did that they did in envy of great Cæsar;  
He only, in a general honest thought  
And common good to all, made one of them.  
His life was gentle; and the elements  
So mix'd in him, that Nature might stand up,  
And say to all the world, "This was a man!"  </code></pre><p>-Shakespeare</p><p>Julius Cæsar."</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
