It has clung to me and so I cling to it. It is just as good as it ever was. It is a sharp thrust at power that depends on externalities. Selleck Osborne. (——.)</p><pre class="  "><code>A supercilious nabob of the East—  
Haughty, being great—purse-proud, being rich—  
A governor, or general, at the least,  
I have forgotten which—  
Had in his family a humble youth,  
Who went from England in his patron's suit,  
An unassuming boy, in truth  
A lad of decent parts, and good repute. </pre></div> </div>
