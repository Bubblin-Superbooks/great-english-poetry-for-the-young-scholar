Parks with oak and chestnut shady,  
Parks and order'd gardens great,  
Ancient homes of lord and lady,  
Built for pleasure and for state.  

All he shows her makes him dearer;  
Evermore she seems to gaze  
On that cottage growing nearer,  
Where they twain will spend their days.  

O but she will love him truly!  
He shall have a cheerful home;  
She will order all things duly  
When beneath his roof they come.  

Thus her heart rejoices greatly </pre></div> </div>
