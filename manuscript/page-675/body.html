As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door"  
'Tis some visitor," I muttered, "tapping at my chamber door—  
Only this, and nothing more."  

Ah! distinctly I remember, it was in the bleak December,  
And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor;  
Eagerly I wished the morrow; vainly I had sought to borrow  
From my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore—  
For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore—  
Nameless here for evermore. </pre></div> </div>
