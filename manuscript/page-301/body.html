But such a tide as moving seems asleep,  
Too full for sound and foam,  
When that which drew from out the boundless deep  
Turns again home.  

Twilight and evening bell,  
And after that the dark!  
And may there be no sadness of farewell,  
When I embark;  

For tho' from out our bourne of Time and Place  
The flood may bear me far,  
I hope to see my Pilot face to face  
When I have cross'd the bar.  </code></pre><p>-Alfred Tennyson.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
