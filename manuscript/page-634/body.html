<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h3>Solitude.</h3><pre class="  "><code>Happy the man, whose wish and care  
A few paternal acres bound,  
Content to breathe his native air  
In his own ground.  

Whose herds with milk, whose fields with bread,  
Whose flocks supply him with attire;  
Whose trees in summer yield him shade,  
In winter fire.  

Blest, who can unconcern'dly find  
Hours, days, and years slide soft away  
In health of body, peace of mind,  
Quiet by day,  

Sound sleep by night; study and ease </pre></div> </div>
