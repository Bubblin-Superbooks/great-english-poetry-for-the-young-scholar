A Youth to Fortune and to Fame unknown;  
Fair Science frown'd not on his humble birth,  
And Melancholy mark'd him for her own.  

Large was his bounty, and his soul sincere,  
Heaven did a recompense as largely send:  
He gave to Mis'ry all he had, a tear:  
He gain'd from Heav'n ('twas all he wish'd a friend.       ) 

No farther seek his merits to disclose,  
Or draw his frailties from their dread abode,  
(There they alike in trembling hope repose,       ) 

The bosom of his Father and his God.  </code></pre><p>-Thomas Gray.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
