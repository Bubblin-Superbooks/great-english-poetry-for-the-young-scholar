Hear it in that battle-peal!  
Read it on yon bristling steel!  
Ask it,—ye who will.  

Fear ye foes who kill for hire?  
Will ye to your homes retire?  
Look behind you! they're afire!  
And, before you, see  
Who have done it!—From the vale  
On they come!—And will ye quail?—  
Leaden rain and iron hail  
Let their welcome be!  

In the God of battles trust!  
Die we may,—and die we must;  
But, O, where can dust to dust  
Be consigned so well, </pre></div> </div>
