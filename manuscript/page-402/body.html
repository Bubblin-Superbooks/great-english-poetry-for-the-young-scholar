<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>An exile from Home, splendour dazzles in vain;<br>O, give me my lowly thatched cottage again!  
The birds singing gaily, that came at my call,—<br>Give me them,—and the peace of mind, dearer than all!  
Home! Home! sweet, sweet Home!  
There's no place like Home! there's no place like Home!</p><p>How sweet 'tis to sit 'neath a fond father's smile,<br>And the cares of a mother to soothe and beguile!  
Let others delight 'mid new pleasures to roam,<br>But give me, oh, give me, the pleasures of Home!  
Home! Home! sweet, sweet Home!  
There's no place like Home! there's no place like Home!</p><p>To thee I'll return, overburdened with care;<br>The heart's dearest solace will smile on me there;<br>No more from that cottage again will I roam;<br>Be it ever so humble, there's no place like Home.<br>Home! Home! sweet, sweet Home!  
There's no place like Home! there's no place like Home!</p></div> </div>
