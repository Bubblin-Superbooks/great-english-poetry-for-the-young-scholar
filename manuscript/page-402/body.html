And while for mercy on Christ they call,  
He set fire to the barn and burned them all.  

"I' faith, 'tis an excellent bonfire!" quoth he;  
"And the country is greatly obliged to me  
For ridding it in these times forlorn  
Of Rats that only consume the corn."  

So then to his palace return√®d he,  
And he sat down to supper merrily,  
And he slept that night like an innocent man;  
But Bishop Hatto never slept again.  

In the morning as he entered the hall,  
Where his picture hung against the wall,  
A sweat-like death all over him came;  
For the Rats had eaten it out of the frame. </pre></div> </div>
