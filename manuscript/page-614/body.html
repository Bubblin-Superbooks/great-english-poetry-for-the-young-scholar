<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">main,<br>Where the sea-egg flames on the coral and the long-backed breakers croon<br>Their endless ocean legends to the lazy, locked lagoon.</p><p>"Strayed amid lonely islets, mazed amid outer keys,<br>I waked the palms to laughter—I tossed the scud in the breeze—<br>Never was isle so little, never was sea so lone,<br>But over the scud and the palm-trees an English flag was flown.</p><p>"I have wrenched it free from the halliard to hang for a wisp on the Horn;<br>I have chased it north to the Lizard—ribboned and rolled and torn;<br>I have spread its fold o'er the dying, adrift in a hopeless sea;<br>I have hurled it swift on the slaver, and seen the slave set free.</p></div> </div>
