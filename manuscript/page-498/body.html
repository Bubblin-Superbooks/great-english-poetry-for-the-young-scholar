And when, above this apple-tree,  
The winter stars are quivering bright,  
The winds go howling through the night,  
Girls, whose eyes o'erflow with mirth,  
Shall peel its fruit by cottage hearth,  
And guests in prouder homes shall see,  
Heaped with the grape of Cintra's vine,  
And golden orange of the line,  
The fruit of the apple-tree.  

The fruitage of this apple-tree,  
Winds and our flag of stripe and star  
Shall bear to coasts that lie afar,  
Where men shall wonder at the view,  
And ask in what fair groves they grew;  
And sojourners beyond the sea </pre></div> </div>
