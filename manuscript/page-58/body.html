Your ring?" Said the piggy, "I will,"  
So they took it away, and were married next day  

the turkey who lives on the hill.  
They dined upon mince and slices of quince,  
Which they ate with a runcible spoon,  
And hand in hand on the edge of the sand  
They danced by the light of the moon,â€”  
The moon,  
They danced by the light of the moon.  </code></pre><p>-Edward Lear.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
