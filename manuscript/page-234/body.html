Tennyson's (1809-92 "Crossing the Bar" is one of the noblest death-songs ever written. I include it in this volume out of respect to a young Philadelphia publisher who recited it one stormy night before the passengers of a ship when I was crossing the Atlantic, and also because so many young people have the good taste to love it. It has been said that next to Browning's "Prospice" it is the greatest death-song ever written.   )

And may there be no moaning of the bar,<br>When I put out to sea,</p><p>But such a tide as moving seems asleep,<br>Too full for sound and foam,<br>When that which drew from out the boundless deep<br>Turns again home.</p></div> </div>
