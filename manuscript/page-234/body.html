I doubtna, whiles, but thou may thieve;  
What then? poor beastie, thou maun live!  
A daimen icker in a thrave  
'S a sma' request:  
I'll get a blessin' wi' the lave,  
And never miss 't!  

Thy wee bit housie, too, in ruin!  
Its silly wa's the win's are strewin'!  
And naething now to big a new ane  
O' foggage green,  
And bleak December's winds ensuin',  
Baith snell and keen!  

Thou saw the fields laid bare and waste,  
And weary winter comin' fast, </pre></div> </div>
