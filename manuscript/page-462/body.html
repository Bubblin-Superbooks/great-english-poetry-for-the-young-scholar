Which, hid by beech and pine,  
Like an eagle's nest, hangs on the crest  
Of purple Apennine.  

The harvests of Arretium,

Shall plunge the struggling sheep;  
And in the vats of Luna,  
This year, the must shall foam

Whose sires have marched to Rome.

The wisest of the land,  
Who alway by Lars Porsena  
Both morn and evening stand: </pre></div> </div>
