And if one ship misbehave,  
——Keel so much as grate the ground,  
Why, I've nothing but my life,—here's my head!" cries Hervé Riel.  

Not a minute more to wait  
"Steer us in, then, small and great!  
Take the helm, lead the line, save the squadron!" cried its chief.  
Captains, give the sailor place!  
He is Admiral, in brief.  
Still the north wind, by God's grace!  
See the noble fellow's face  
As the big ship, with a bound,  
Clears the entry like a hound,  
Keeps the passage as its inch of way were the wide sea's profound! </pre></div> </div>
