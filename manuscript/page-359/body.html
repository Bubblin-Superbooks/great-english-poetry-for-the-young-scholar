"And will it, truly?" questioned she—  
Her laughing lips and eager eyes  
All in a sparkle of surprise—  
"And shall your little Mädchen see?"  
"She shall!" I said. How could I tell  
That ere the worm within its shell  
Its gauzy, splendid wings had spread,  
My little Mädchen would be dead?  

To-day the butterfly has flown,—  
She was not here to see it fly,—  
And sorrowing I wonder why  
The empty shell is mine alone.  
Perhaps the secret lies in this:  
I too had found a chrysalis,  
And Death that robbed me of delight </pre></div> </div>
