That serveth not another's will;  
Whose armour is his honest thought,  
And simple truth his utmost skill!  

Whose passions not his master's are,  
Whose soul is still prepared for death,  
Not tied unto the world with care  
Of public fame, or private breath.  </code></pre><p>-Sir Henry Wotton.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
