<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>There, in thy scanty mantle clad,<br>Thy snawie bosom sunward spread,<br>Thou lifts thy unassuming head<br>In humble guise;<br>But now the share uptears thy bed,<br>And low thou lies!</p><p>Such is the fate of artless maid,<br>Sweet floweret of the rural shade!  
By love's simplicity betrayed,<br>And guileless trust,<br>Till she, like thee, all soiled, is laid<br>Low i' the dust.</p><p>Such is the fate of simple bard,<br>On life's rough ocean luckless starr'd!  
Unskilful he to note the card<br>Of prudent lore,<br>Till billows rage, and gales blow hard,<br>And whelm him o'er!</p></div> </div>
