Of roses laid his weary head;  
Luckless urchin, not to see  
Within the leaves a slumbering bee.  
The bee awak'd—with anger wild  
The bee awak'd, and stung the child.  
Loud and piteous are his cries;  
To Venus quick he runs, he flies;  
"Oh, Mother! I am wounded through—  
I die with pain—in sooth I do!  
Stung by some little angry thing,  
Some serpent on a tiny wing—  
A bee it was—for once, I know,  
I heard a rustic call it so."  
Thus he spoke, and she the while  
Heard him with a soothing smile; </pre></div> </div>
