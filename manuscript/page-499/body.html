Shall think of childhood's careless day,  
And long, long hours of summer play,  
In the shade of the apple-tree.  

Each year shall give this apple-tree  
A broader flush of roseate bloom,  
A deeper maze of verdurous gloom,  
And loosen, when the frost-clouds lower,  
The crisp brown leaves in thicker shower.  
The years shall come and pass, but we  
Shall hear no longer, where we lie,  
The summer's songs, the autumn's sigh,  
In the boughs of the apple-tree.  

And time shall waste this apple-tree.  
Oh, when its aged branches throw  
Thin shadows on the ground below, </pre></div> </div>
