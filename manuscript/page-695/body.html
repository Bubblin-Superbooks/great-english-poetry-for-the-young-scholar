'Tis mightiest in the mightiest; it becomes  
The throned monarch better than his crown:  
His scepter shows the force of temporal power,  
The attribute to awe and majesty,  
Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings;  
But mercy is above his sceptered sway;  
It is enthroned in the hearts of kings,  
It is an attribute to God himself;  
And earthly power doth then show likest God's  
When mercy seasons justice. </code></pre><p>-Shakespeare</p><blockquote><p>"Merchant of Venice."</p></blockquote><hr class="section"></div> </div>
