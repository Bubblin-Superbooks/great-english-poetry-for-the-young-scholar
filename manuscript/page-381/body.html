The lances unlifted, the trumpet unblown.  

And the widows of Ashur are loud in their wail,  
And the idols are broke in the temple of Baal;  
And the might of the Gentile, unsmote by the sword,  
Hath melted like snow in the glance of the Lord!</code></pre><p>-Lord Byron.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
