What anvils rang, what hammers beat,  
In what a forge and what a heat  
Were forged the anchors of thy hope!  
Fear not each sudden sound and shockâ€”  
'Tis of the wave, and not the rock;  
'Tis but the flapping of the sail,  
And not a rent made by the gale!  
In spite of rock, and tempest roar,  
In spite of false lights on the shore,  
Sail on, nor fear to breast the sea!  
Our hearts, our hopes, are all with thee.  
Our hearts, our hopes, our prayers, our tears,  
Our faith, triumphant o'er our fears,  
Are all with thee, are all with thee!  </code></pre><p>-Henry W. Longfellow.</p><blockquote class="  "><p>The Constitution and Laws are here personified, and</blockquote></div> </div>
