Forgive, ye Proud, th' involuntary fault  
If Memory to these no trophies raise,  
Where thro' the long-drawn aisle and fretted vault  
The pealing anthem swells the note of praise.  

Can storied urn or animated bust  
Back to its mansion call the fleeting breath?  
Can Honour's voice provoke the silent dust,  
Or Flatt'ry soothe the dull cold ear of Death?  

Perhaps in this neglected spot is laid  
Some heart once pregnant with celestial fire,  
Hands that the rod of empire might have sway'd,  
Or waked to ecstasy the living lyre.  

But Knowledge to their eyes her ample page </pre></div> </div>
