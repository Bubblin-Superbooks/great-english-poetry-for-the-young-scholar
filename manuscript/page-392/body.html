Where with maiden Nis went he,—  
It is winter on the shore,  
Winter, winter evermore.  

Of the summer on the deep  
Come sweet visions in my sleep;  
_His_ fair face lifts from the sea,  
_His_ dear voice calls out to me,—  
These my dreams of summer be.  

Krinken was a little child,  
By the maiden Nis beguiled;  
Oft the hoary sea and grim  
Reached its longing arms to him,  
Crying, "Sim-child, come to me;  
Let me warm my heart with thee!"  
But the sea calls out no more; </pre></div> </div>
