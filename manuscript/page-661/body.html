Tell friendship of unkindnesse;  
Tell justice of delay;  
And if they dare reply,  
Then give them all the lye.  

Tell arts they have no soundnesse,  
But vary by esteeming;  
Tell schooles they want profoundnesse,  
And stand too much on seeming;  
If arts and schooles reply,  
Give arts and schooles the lye.  

So, when thou hast, as I  
Commanded thee, done blabbing—  
Although to give the lye  
Deserves no less than stabbing—  
Yet stab at thee who will, </pre></div> </div>
