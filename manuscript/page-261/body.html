Charge for the guns!" he said:  
Into the valley of Death  
Rode the six hundred.  

"Forward, the Light Brigade!"  
Was there a man dismay'd?  
Not tho' the soldier knew

Theirs not to make reply,  
Theirs not to reason why.  
Theirs but to do and die:  
Into the valley of Death  
Rode the six hundred.  

Cannon to right of them,  
Cannon to left of them,  
Cannon in front of them </pre></div> </div>
