In this sonnet the poetess has touched the power of Wordsworth or Keats and placed herself among the immortals.</p><pre class="  "><code>The God of Music dwelleth out of doors.  
All seasons through his minstrelsy we meet,  
Breathing by field and covert haunting-sweet  
From organ-lofts in forests old he pours:  
A solemn harmony: on leafy floors  
To smooth autumnal pipes he moves his feet,  
Or with the tingling plectrum of the sleet  
In winter keen beats out his thrilling scores. </pre></div> </div>
