In making such a collection as this it is not easy to find poems at once delicate, witty, and graphic. I have taught "The Duel" hundreds of times, and children invariably love it.</p><pre class="  "><code>The gingham dog and the calico cat

Nor one nor t'other had slept a wink!  
The old Dutch clock and the Chinese plate </pre></div> </div>
