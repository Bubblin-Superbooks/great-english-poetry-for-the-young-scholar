Oh! give me the flashing brine,  
The spray and the tempest's roar!  

Once more on the deck I stand  
Of my own swift-gliding craft:  
Set sail! farewell to the land!  
The gale follows fair abaft.  
We shoot through the sparkling foam  
Like an ocean-bird set free;â€”  
Like the ocean-bird, our home  
We'll find far out on the sea.  

The land is no longer in view,  
The clouds have begun to frown;  
But with a stout vessel and crew,  
We'll say, Let the storm come down!  
And the song of our hearts shall be, </pre></div> </div>
