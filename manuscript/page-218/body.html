<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>When Letty had scarce pass'd her third glad year,<br>And her young, artless words began to flow,<br>One day we gave the child a colour'd sphere<br>Of the wide earth, that she might mark and know,<br>By tint and outline, all its sea and land.<br>She patted all the world; old empires peep'd<br>Between her baby fingers; her soft hand<br>Was welcome at all frontiers. How she leap'd,<br>And laugh'd and prattled in her world-wide bliss!  
But when we turn'd her sweet unlearned eye<br>On our own isle, she rais'd a joyous cry,<br>"Oh! yes, I see it! Letty's home is there!"<br>And, while she hid all England with a kiss,<br>Bright over Europe fell her golden hair!</p><pre class="  "><code>
