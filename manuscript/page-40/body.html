<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h3>Playing Robinson Crusoe.</h3><pre class="  "><code>Pussy can sit by the fire and sing,  
Pussy can climb a tree,  
Or play with a silly old cork and string  
To 'muse herself, not me.  
But I like Binkie, my dog, because  
He knows how to behave;  
So, Binkie's the same as the First Friend was,  
And I am the Man in the Cave.  

Pussy will play Man-Friday till  
It's time to wet her paw  
And make her walk on the window-sill  
(For the footprint Crusoe saw);  
Then she fluffles her tail and mews, </pre></div> </div>
