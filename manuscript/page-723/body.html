Rather I prize the doubt  
Low kinds exist without,  
Finish'd and finite clods, untroubled by a spark.  

Poor vaunt of life indeed,  
Were man but formed to feed  
On joy, to solely seek and find and feast:  
Such feasting ended, then  
As sure an end to men;  
Irks care the crop-full bird? Frets doubt the maw-cramm'd beast?  

Rejoice we are allied  
To That which doth provide  
And not partake, effect and not receive!  
A spark disturbs our clod;  
Nearer we hold of God </pre></div> </div>
