East and west and south and north,  
To summon his array.  

East and west and south and north  
The messengers ride fast,  
And tower and town and cottage  
Have heard the trumpet's blast.  
Shame on the false Etruscan  
Who lingers in his home  
When Porsena of Clusium  
Is on the march for Rome!  

The horsemen and the footmen  
Are pouring in amain,  
From many a stately market-place,  
From many a fruitful plain;  
From many a lonely hamlet, </pre></div> </div>
