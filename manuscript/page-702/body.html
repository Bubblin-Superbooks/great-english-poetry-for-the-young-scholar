May I reach  
That purest heaven,â€”be to other souls  
The cup of strength in some great agony,  
Enkindle generous ardour, feed pure love,  
Beget the smiles that have no cruelty,  
Be the sweet presence of good diffused,  
And in diffusion ever more intense!  
So shall I join the choir invisible,  
Whose music is the gladness of the world.  </code></pre><p>-George Eliot.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
