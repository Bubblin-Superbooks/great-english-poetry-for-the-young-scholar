Children dear, was it yesterday  
(Call yet once that she went away?       ) 

Once she sate with you and me,  
On a red gold throne in the heart of the sea,  
And the youngest sate on her knee.  
She comb'd its bright hair, and she tended it well,  
When down swung the sound of a far-off bell.  
She sigh'd, she look'd up through the clear green sea;  
She said: "I must go, for my kinsfolk pray  
In the little gray church on the shore to-day.  
'Twill be Easter-time in the worldâ€”ah me!  
And I lose my poor soul, Merman! here with thee."  
I said: "Go up, dear heart, through the waves;  
Say thy prayer, and come back to the kind sea-caves!"  
She smil'd, she went up through the surf in the bay. </pre></div> </div>
