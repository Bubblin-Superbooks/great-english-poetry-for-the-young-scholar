<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">sea,<br>And the reindeer bounds o'er the pastures free,<br>And the pine has a fringe of softer green,<br>And the moss looks bright, where my step has been.</p><p>I have sent through the wood-paths a glowing sigh,<br>And called out each voice of the deep blue sky,<br>From the night-bird's lay through the starry time,<br>In the groves of the soft Hesperian clime,<br>To the swan's wild note by the Iceland lakes,<br>When the dark fir-branch into verdure breaks.</p><p>From the streams and founts I have loosed the chain;<br>They are sweeping on to the silvery main,<br>They are flashing down from the mountain brows,<br>They are flinging spray o'er the forest boughs,<br>They are bursting fresh from their sparry caves,<br>And the earth resounds with the joy of waves.</p></div> </div>
