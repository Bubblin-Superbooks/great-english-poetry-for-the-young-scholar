And a scornful laugh laughed he.  

Colder and louder blew the wind,  
A gale from the northeast,  
The snow fell hissing in the brine,  
And the billows frothed like yeast.  

Down came the storm, and smote amain  
The vessel in its strength;  
She shuddered and paused, like a frighted steed,  
Then leaped her cable's length.  

"Come hither! come hither! my little daughter,  
And do not tremble so;  
For I can weather the roughest gale  
That ever wind did blow." </pre></div> </div>
