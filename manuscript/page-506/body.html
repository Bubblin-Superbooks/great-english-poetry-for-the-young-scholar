"A Psalm of Life," by Henry W. Longfellow (1807-82), is like a treasure laid up in heaven. It should be learned for its future value to the child, not necessarily because the child likes it. Its value will dawn on him.</p></blockquote><pre class="  "><code>Tell me not, in mournful numbers,  
Life is but an empty dream!â€”  
For the soul is dead that slumbers,  
And things are not what they seem.  

Life is real! Life is earnest!  
And the grave is not its goal; </pre></div> </div>
