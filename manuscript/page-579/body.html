Long and loud.  
Four galleons drew away  
From the Spanish fleet that day,  
And two upon the larboard and two upon the starboard lay,  
And the battle-thunder broke from them all.  

But anon the great _San Philip_, she bethought herself and went,  
Having that within her womb that had left her ill content;  
And the rest they came aboard us, and they fought us hand to hand,  
For a dozen times they came with their pikes and musqueteers,  
And a dozen times we shook 'em off as a dog that shakes his ears </pre></div> </div>
