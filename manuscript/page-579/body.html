<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">peal,<br>The new wine's foaming flow,<br>The master's lips aglow!  
Thou, heaven's consummate cup, what need'st thou with earth's wheel?</p><p>But I need, now as then,<br>Thee, God, who mouldest men;<br>And since, not even while the whirl was worst<br>Did I,—to the wheel of life<br>With shapes and colours rife,<br>Bound dizzily,—mistake my end, to slake Thy thirst:</p><p>So, take and use Thy work:<br>Amend what flaws may lurk,<br>What strain o' the stuff, what warpings past the aim!  
My times be in Thy hand!  
Perfect the cup as plann'd!  
Lest age approve of youth, and death complete the same!</p></div> </div>
