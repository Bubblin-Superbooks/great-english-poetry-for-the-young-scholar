The fisher is out on the sunny sea,  
And the reindeer bounds o'er the pastures free,  
And the pine has a fringe of softer green,  
And the moss looks bright, where my step has been.  

I have sent through the wood-paths a glowing sigh,  
And called out each voice of the deep blue sky,  
From the night-bird's lay through the starry time,  
In the groves of the soft Hesperian clime,  
To the swan's wild note by the Iceland lakes,  
When the dark fir-branch into verdure breaks.  

From the streams and founts I have loosed the chain;  
They are sweeping on to the silvery main,  
They are flashing down from the mountain brows,  
They are flinging spray o'er the forest boughs,  
They are bursting fresh from their sparry caves, </pre></div> </div>
