Land of the Pilgrims' pride;  
From every mountain side,  
Let freedom ring.  

My native country, thee—  
Land of the noble free—  
Thy name I love;  
I love thy rocks and rills,  
Thy woods and templed hills;  
My heart with rapture thrills,  
Like that above.  

Let music swell the breeze,  
And ring from all the trees  
Sweet freedom's song;  
Let mortal tongues awake;  
Let all that breathe partake; </pre></div> </div>
