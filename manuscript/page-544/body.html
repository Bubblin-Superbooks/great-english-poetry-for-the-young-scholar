<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h3>Moly.</h3><p class="  start-chapter">"Moly" (mo'ly), by Edith M. Thomas (1850-), in the best possible presentation of the value of integrity. This poem ranks with "Sir Galahad," if not above it. It is a stroke of genius, and every American ought to be proud of it. Every time my boys read "Odysseus" or the story of Ulysses with me we read or learn "Moly." The plant moly grows in the United States as well as in Europe.</p><pre class="  "><code>Traveller, pluck a stem of moly,  
If thou touch at Circe's isle,â€”  
Hermes' moly, growing solely  
To undo enchanter's wile! </pre></div> </div>
