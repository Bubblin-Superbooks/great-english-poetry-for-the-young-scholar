Bishop Hatto fearfully hastened away,  
And he crossed the Rhine without delay,  
And reached his tower, and barred with care  
All windows, doors, and loop-holes there.  

He laid him down, and closed his eyes;  
But soon a scream made him arise:  
He started and saw two eyes of flame  
On his pillow, from whence the screaming came.  

He listened and looked; it was only the cat:  
But the Bishop he grew more fearful for that;  
For she sat screaming, mad with fear  
At the army of Rats that was drawing near.
