"In my youth," said his father, "I took to the law,  
And argued each case with my wife;  
And the muscular strength which it gave to my jaw  
Has lasted the rest of my life."  

"You are old," said the youth; "one would hardly suppose  
That your eye was as steady as ever;  
Yet you balanced an eel on the end of your noseâ€”  
What made you so awfully clever?"  

"I have answered three questions, and that is enough,"  
Said his father, "don't give yourself airs!  
Do you think I can listen all day to such stuff?  
Be off, or I'll kick you down-stairs!"  </code></pre><p>-Lewis Carroll.</p></div> </div>
