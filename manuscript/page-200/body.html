Fading slowly from his side;  
Three fair children first she bore him,  
Then before her time she died.  

Weeping, weeping late and early,  
Walking up and pacing down,  
Deeply mourn'd the Lord of Burleigh,  
Burleigh-house by Stamford-town.  

And he came to look upon her,  
And he look'd at her and said,  
"Bring the dress and put it on her  
That she wore when she was wed."  

Then her people, softly treading,  
Bore to earth her body, drest  
In the dress that she was wed in, </pre></div> </div>
