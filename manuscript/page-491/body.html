Now round him throng the Fathers  
To press his gory hands;  
And now with shouts and clapping,  
And noise of weeping loud,  
He enters through the River Gate,  
Borne by the joyous crowd.  

They gave him of the corn land,  
That was of public right.  
As much as two strong oxen  
Could plow from morn till night:  
And they made a molten image,  
And set it up on high,  
And there it stands unto this day  
To witness if I lie.  

It stands in the Comitium, </pre></div> </div>
