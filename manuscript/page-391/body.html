To the summer-lands that be  
Down within the silver sea."  

Krinken was a little child—  
By the maiden Nis beguiled,  
Hand in hand with her went he  
And 'twas summer in the sea.  
And the hoary sea and grim  
To its bosom folded him—  
Clasped and kissed the little form,  
And the ocean's heart was warm.  

Now the sea calls out no more;  
It is winter on the shore,—  
Winter where that little child  
Made sweet summer when he smiled;  
Though 'tis summer on the sea </pre></div> </div>
