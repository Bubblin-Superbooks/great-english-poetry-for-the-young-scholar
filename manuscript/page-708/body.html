When first she gleamed upon my sight;  
A lovely Apparition, sent  
To be a moment's ornament;  
Her eyes as stars of Twilight fair;  
Like Twilight's, too, her dusky hair:  
But all things else about her drawn  
From May-time and the cheerful Dawn.  
A dancing Shape, an Image gay,  
To haunt, to startle, and waylay.  

I saw her upon nearer view,  
A Spirit, yet a Woman too!  
Her household motions light and free,  
And steps of virgin liberty;  
A countenance in which did meet  
Sweet records, promises as sweet;  
A Creature not too bright or good </pre></div> </div>
