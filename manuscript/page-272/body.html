In the air  
Nowhere  
Was a moonbeam bare;  
Far off and harmless the shy stars shone—  
Sure and certain the Moon was gone!  

The Wind he took to his revels once more;  
On down,  
In town,  
Like a merry-mad clown,  
He leaped and hallooed with whistle and roar—  
"What's that?" The glimmering thread once more!  

He flew in a rage—he danced and blew;  
But in vain  
Was the pain  
Of his bursting brain; </pre></div> </div>
