The Frenchmen's captain had a name I wish I could pronounce;  
A Breton gentleman was he, and wholly free from bounce,  
One like those famous fellows who died by guillotine  
For honour and the fleur-de-lys, and Antoinette the Queen.  

The Catholic for Louis, the Protestant for George,  
Each captain drew as bright a sword as saintly smiths could forge;  
And both were simple seamen, but both could understand  
How each was bound to win or die for flag and native land. </pre></div> </div>
