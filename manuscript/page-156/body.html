There is a wonderful ivy growing at Rhudlan, in northern Wales. Its roots are so large and strong that they form a comfortable seat for many persons, and no one can remember when they were smaller. This ivy envelops a great castle in ruins. Every child in that locality loves the old ivy. It is typical of the ivy as seen all through Wales and England.</p><pre class="  "><code>O, a dainty plant is the ivy green,  
That creepeth o'er ruins old!  
Of right choice food are his meals, I ween, </pre></div> </div>
