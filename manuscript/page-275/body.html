Joseph the carpenter—same trade as me—  
I thought as I'd find it—I knew it was here—  
But my sight's getting queer.  

I don't know right where as His shed must ha' stood—  
But often, as I've been a-planing my wood,  
I've took off my hat, just with thinking of He  
At the same work as me. </pre></div> </div>
