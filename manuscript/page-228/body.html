The swallows skim the river's brink;  
And home to the woodland fly the crows,  
When over the hill the farm-boy goes,  
Cheerily calling,—  
"Co', boss! co', boss! co'! co'! co'!"  
Farther, farther over the hill,  
Faintly calling, calling still,—  
"Co', boss! co', boss! co'! co'!"  

Into the yard the farmer goes,  
With grateful heart, at the close of day;  
Harness and chain are hung away;  
In the wagon-shed stand yoke and plow;  
The straw's in the stack, the hay in the mow;  
The cooling dews are falling;—  
The friendly sheep his welcome bleat,  
The pigs come grunting to his feet, </pre></div> </div>
