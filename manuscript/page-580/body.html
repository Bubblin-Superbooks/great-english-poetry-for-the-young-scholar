### Prospice.

"Prospice," by Robert Browning (1812-89), is the greatest death song ever written. It is a battle-song and a pÃ¦an of victory.

> "The journey is done, the summit attained,  
> And the strong man must go."  
> "I would hate that Death bandaged my eyes and forebore,  
> And bade me creep past."  
> "No! let me taste the whole of it"  
> "The reward of all." </pre></div> </div>
