When he leaps from the water to the land.  

And the sun went down, and the stars came out far over the summer sea,  
But never a moment ceased the fight of the one and the fifty-three;  
Ship after ship, the whole night long, their high-built galleons came,  
Ship after ship, the whole night long, with her battle-thunder and flame;  
Ship after ship, the whole night long, drew back with her dead and her shame.  
For some were sunk and many were shatter'd, and so could fight us no moreâ€”  
God of battles, was ever a battle like this in the world before? </pre></div> </div>
