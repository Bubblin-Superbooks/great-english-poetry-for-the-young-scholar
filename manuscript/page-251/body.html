### How Sleep the Brave.
</code></pre><p>How sleep the brave, who sink to rest<br>By all their country's wishes blest!  
When Spring, with dewy fingers cold,<br>Returns to deck their hallow'd mould,<br>She there shall dress a sweeter sod<br>Than Fancy's feet have ever trod.</p><p>By fairy hands their knell is rung,<br>By forms unseen their dirge is sung:<br>There Honour comes, a pilgrim gray,<br>To bless the turf that wraps their clay;<br>And Freedom shall a while repair<br>To dwell a weeping hermit there!</p></div> </div>
