<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h3>Fidelity.</h3><p class="  start-chapter">"Fidelity," by William Wordsworth (1770-1850), is placed here out of respect to a boy of eleven years who liked the poem well enough to recite it frequently. The scene is laid on Helvellyn, to me the most impressive mountain of the Lake District of England. Wordsworth is a part of this country. I once heard John Burroughs say: "I went to the Lake District to see what kind of a country it could be that would produce a Wordsworth."</p><pre class="  "><code>A barking sound the Shepherd hears,
