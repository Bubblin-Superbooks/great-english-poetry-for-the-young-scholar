The boy—oh! where was he?  
——Ask of the winds that far around  
With fragments strew the sea;  

With mast, and helm, and pennon fair.  
That well had borne their part—  
But the noblest thing that perished there  
Was that young, faithful heart.  </code></pre><p>-Felicia Hemans.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
