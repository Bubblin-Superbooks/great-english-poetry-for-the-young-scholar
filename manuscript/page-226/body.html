"What writest thou?" The vision raised its head,  
And, with a look made of all sweet accord,  
Answered, "The names of those who love the Lord."  

"And is mine one?" said Abou. "Nay, not so,"  
Replied the angel. Abou spoke more low,  
But cheerly still; and said, "I pray thee, then,  
Write me as one that loves his fellow-men."  

The angel wrote, and vanished. The next night  
It came again, with a great wakening light,  
And showed the names whom love of God had blessed;  
And, lo! Ben Adhem's name led all the rest.  </code></pre><p>-Leigh Hunt.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
