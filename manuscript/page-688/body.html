Along the billows to the sun.  

Opposed to these a hovering band  
Contended for their fatherland;  
Peasants, whose new-found strength had broke  
From manly necks the ignoble yoke,  
And beat their fetters into swords,  
On equal terms to fight their lords;  
And what insurgent rage had gained,  
In many a mortal fray maintained;  
Marshalled, once more, at Freedom's call,  
They came to conquer or to fall,  
Where he who conquered, he who fell,  
Was deemed a dead or living Tell,  
Such virtue had that patriot breathed,  
So to the soil his soul bequeathed,  
That wheresoe'er his arrows flew, </pre></div> </div>
