Then rush'd the steed to battle driven,  
And louder than the bolts of Heaven,  
Far flashed the red artillery.  

But redder yet that light shall glow  
On Linden's hills or stain√®d snow;  
And bloodier yet the torrent flow  
Of Iser, rolling rapidly.  

'Tis morn, but scarce yon level sun  
Can pierce the war-clouds, rolling dun,  
Where furious Frank, and fiery Hun,  
Shout in their sulphurous canopy.  

The combat deepens. On, ye brave  
Who rush to glory or the grave!  
Wave, Munich! all thy banners wave, </pre></div> </div>
