How they built their nests in summer,  
Where they hid themselves in winter,  
Talked with them whene'er he met them,  
Called them "Hiawatha's Chickens."  

Of all beasts he learned the language,  
Learned their names and all their secrets,  
How the beavers built their lodges,  
Where the squirrels hid their acorns,  
How the reindeer ran so swiftly,  
Why the rabbit was so timid,  
Talked with them whene'er he met them,  
Called them "Hiawatha's Brothers."  </code></pre><p>-Henry W. Longfellow.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
