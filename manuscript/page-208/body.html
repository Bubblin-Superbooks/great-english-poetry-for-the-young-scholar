Where the jousters were Heart and Brain.  

> II.

Flourished the trumpets, entered Heart,  
A youth in crimson and gold;  
Flourished again; Brain stood apart,  
Steel-armoured, dark and cold.  

> III.

Heart's palfrey caracoled gaily round,  
Heart tra-li-ra'd merrily;  
But Brain sat still, with never a sound,  
So cynical-calm was he. </pre></div> </div>
