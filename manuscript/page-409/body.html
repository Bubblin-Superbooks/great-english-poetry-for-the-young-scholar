Until at last the blanch'd mate said;  
"Why, now, not even God would know  
Should I and all my men fall dead.  
These very winds forget their way,  
For God from these dread seas is gone.  
Now speak, brave Admiral, and say——"  
He said: "Sail on! and on!"  

They sailed, they sailed, then spoke his mate:  
"This mad sea shows his teeth to-night,  
He curls his lip, he lies in wait,  
With lifted teeth as if to bite!  
Brave Admiral, say but one word;  
What shall we do when hope is gone?"  
The words leaped as a leaping sword:  
"Sail on! sail on! and on!" </pre></div> </div>
