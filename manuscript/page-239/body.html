There, in thy scanty mantle clad,  
Thy snawie bosom sunward spread,  
Thou lifts thy unassuming head  
In humble guise;  
But now the share uptears thy bed,  
And low thou lies!  

Such is the fate of artless maid,  
Sweet floweret of the rural shade!  
By love's simplicity betrayed,  
And guileless trust,  
Till she, like thee, all soiled, is laid  
Low i' the dust.  

Such is the fate of simple bard,  
On life's rough ocean luckless starr'd! </pre></div> </div>
