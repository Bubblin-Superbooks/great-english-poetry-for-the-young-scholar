<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">
O'er the red streamer that heralds the day,  
Over the cloudlet dim,  
Over the rainbow's rim,  
Musical cherub, soar, singing, away!  

Then, when the gloaming comes,  
Low in the heather blooms  
Sweet will thy welcome and bed of love be!  
Emblem of happiness,  
Blest is thy dwelling-placeâ€”  
Oh, to abide in the desert with thee!  </code></pre><p>-Thomas Hogg.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
