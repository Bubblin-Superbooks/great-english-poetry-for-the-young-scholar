<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="  "><code>Serene I fold my hands and wait,  
Nor care for wind, nor tide, nor sea.  
I rave no more 'gainst time or fate,  
For lo! my own shall come to me.  

I stay my haste, I make delays,  
For what avails this eager pace?  
I stand amid the eternal ways,  
And what is mine shall know my face.  

Asleep, awake, by night or day  
The friends I seek are seeking me;  
No wind can drive my bark astray,  
Nor change the tide of destiny.  

What matter if I stand alone?  
I wait with joy the coming years;  
My heart shall reap when it has sown, </pre></div> </div>
