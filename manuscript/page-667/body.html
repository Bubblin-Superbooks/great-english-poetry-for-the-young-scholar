Content I live; this is my stay,â€”  
I seek no more than may suffice.  
I press to bear no haughty sway;  
Look, what I lack my mind supplies.  
Lo, thus I triumph like a king,  
Content with that my mind doth bring.  

I laugh not at another's loss,  
I grudge not at another's gain;  
No worldly wave my mind can toss;  
I brook that is another's bane.  
I fear no foe, nor fawn on friend;  
I loathe not life, nor dread mine end.  

My wealth is health and perfect ease;  
My conscience clear my chief defense; </pre></div> </div>
