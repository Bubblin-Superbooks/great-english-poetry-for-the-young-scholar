He steers his course for Scotland's shore.  

So thick a haze o'erspread the sky,  
They cannot see the sun on high:  
The wind hath blown a gale all day,  
At evening it hath died away.  

On the deck the Rover takes his stand;  
So dark it is they see no land.  
Quoth Sir Ralph, "It will be brighter soon,  
For there is the dawn of the rising moon."  

"Canst hear," said one, "the broken roar?  
For methinks we should be near the shore."  
"Now where we are I cannot tell,  
But I wish I could hear the Inchcape Bell." </pre></div> </div>
