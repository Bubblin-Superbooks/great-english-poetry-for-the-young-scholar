When fond recollection presents them to view!  
The orchard, the meadow, the deep-tangled wild-wood,  
And every loved spot which my infancy knew!  
The wide-spreading pond, and the mill that stood by it,  
The bridge, and the rock where the cataract fell,  
The cot of my father, the dairy-house nigh it,  
And e'en the rude bucket that hung in the wellâ€”  
The old oaken bucket, the iron-bound bucket, </pre></div> </div>
