<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">
What once a tortoise served to cover;  
A year and more, with rush and roar,  
The surf had rolled it over,  
Had played with it, and flung it by,  
As wind and weather might decide it,  
Then tossed it high where sand-drifts dry  
Cheap burial might provide it.  

It rested there to bleach or tan,  
The rains had soaked, the sun had burned it;  
With many a ban the fisherman  
Had stumbled o'er and spurned it;  
And there the fisher-girl would stay,  
Conjecturing with her brother  
How in their play the poor estray  
Might serve some use or other. </pre></div> </div>
