As the bird wings and sings,  
Let us cry, "All good things  
Are ours, nor soul helps flesh more, now, than flesh helps soul!"  

Therefore I summon age  
To grant youth's heritage,  
Life's struggle having so far reached its term:  
Thence shall I pass, approved  
A man, for aye removed  
From the developed brute; a god though in the germ.  

And I shall thereupon  
Take rest, ere I be gone  
Once more on my adventure brave and new:  
Fearless and unperplex'd,  
When I wage battle next, </pre></div> </div>
