Dewy with Nature's tear-drops, as they pass,  
Grieving, if aught inanimate e'er grieves,  
Over the unreturning brave—alas!  
Ere evening to be trodden like the grass  
Which, now beneath them, but above shall grow  
In its next verdure, when this fiery mass  
Of living valour, rolling on the foe,  
And burning with high hope, shall moulder cold and low.  

Last noon beheld them full of lusty life,  
Last eve in Beauty's circle proudly gay;  
The midnight brought the signal-sound of strife,  
The morn the marshalling in arms,—the day,  
Battle's magnificently stern array!  
The thunder-clouds close o'er it, which, when rent,  
The earth is covered thick with other clay, </pre></div> </div>
