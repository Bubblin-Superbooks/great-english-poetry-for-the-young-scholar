This poem is very dramatic, and the music of the refrain has done much to make it popular. But the pathos is that which endears it.</p><pre class="  "><code>The old mayor climb'd the belfry tower,  
The ringers ran by two, by three;  
"Pull, if ye never pull'd before;  
Good ringers, pull your best," quoth he.  
"Play uppe, play uppe, O Boston bells!  
Ply all your changes, all your swells,  
Play uppe, 'The Brides of Enderby.'" </pre></div> </div>
