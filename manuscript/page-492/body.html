Plain for all folk to see,â€”  
Horatius in his harness,  
Halting upon one knee:  
And underneath is written,  
In letters all of gold,  
How valiantly he kept the bridge  
In the brave days of old.  

And still his name sounds stirring  
Unto the men of Rome,  
As the trumpet blast that cries to them  
To charge the Volscian home;  
And wives still pray to Juno  
For boys with hearts as bold  
As his who kept the bridge so well  
In the brave days of old. </pre></div> </div>
