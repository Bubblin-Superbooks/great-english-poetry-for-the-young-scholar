And press it o'er them tenderly,  
As round the sleeping infant's feet  
We softly fold the cradle sheet;  
So plant we the apple-tree.  

What plant we in this apple-tree?  
Buds, which the breath of summer days  
Shall lengthen into leafy sprays;  
Boughs where the thrush, with crimson breast,  
Shall haunt, and sing, and hide her nest;  
We plant, upon the sunny lea,  
A shadow for the noontide hour,  
A shelter from the summer shower,  
When we plant the apple-tree.  

What plant we in this apple-tree?  
Sweets for a hundred flowery springs, </pre></div> </div>
