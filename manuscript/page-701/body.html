Of those immortal dead who live again  
In minds made better by their presence; live  
In pulses stirred to generosity,  
In deeds of daring rectitude, in scorn  
Of miserable aims that end with self,  
In thoughts sublime that pierce the night like stars,  
And with their mild persistence urge men's minds  
To vaster issues. </pre></div> </div>
