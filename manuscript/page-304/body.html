From aloe to rose-oak, from rose-oak to fir,  
From level to upland, from upland to crest,  
From rice-field to rock-ridge, from rock-ridge to spur,  
Fly the soft-sandalled feet, strains the brawny brown chest.  
From rail to ravine—to the peak from the vale—  
Up, up through the night goes the Overland-Mail.  

There's a speck on the hillside, a dot on the road—  
A jingle of bells on the foot-path below—  
There's a scuffle above in the monkeys' abode—  
The world is awake, and the clouds are aglow—  
For the great Sun himself must attend to the hail;—  
In the name of the Empress the Overland-Mail.  </code></pre><p>-Rudyard Kipling.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
