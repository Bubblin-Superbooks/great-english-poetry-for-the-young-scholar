Then all the mighty floods were out.  

So farre, so fast the eygre drave,  
The heart had hardly time to beat  
Before a shallow seething wave  
Sobb'd in the grasses at oure feet:  
The feet had hardly time to flee  
Before it brake against the knee,  
And all the world was in the sea.  

Upon the roofe we sate that night,  
The noise of bells went sweeping by;  
I mark'd the lofty beacon light  
Stream from the church tower, red and highâ€”  
A lurid mark and dread to see;  
And awsome bells they were to mee,  
That in the dark rang "Enderby." </pre></div> </div>
