Not strong but by their factions;  
If potentates reply,  
Give potentates the lye.  

Tell men of high condition,  
That rule affairs of state,  
Their purpose is ambition,  
Their practice only hate;  
And if they once reply,  
Then give them all the lye.  

Tell zeale it lacks devotion;  
Tell love it is but lust;  
Tell time it is but motion;  
Tell flesh it is but dust;  
And wish them not reply,  
For thou must give the lye. </pre></div> </div>
