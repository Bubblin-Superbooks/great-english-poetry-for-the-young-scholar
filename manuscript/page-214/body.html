Showed he began to fail.  

His colour sickened more and more,  
He faded into age;  
And then his enemies began  
To show their deadly rage.  

They took a weapon long and sharp,  
And cut him by the knee,  
Then tied him fast upon a cart,  
Like a rogue for forgery.  

They laid him down upon his back,  
And cudgelled him full sore;  
They hung him up before the storm,  
And turn'd him o'er and o'er. </pre></div> </div>
