I blew her to death—<br>First blew her away right out of the sky—<br>Then blew her in; what strength have I!"</p><p>But the Moon she knew nothing about the affair;<br>For high<br>In the sky,<br>With her one white eye,<br>Motionless, miles above the air,<br>She had never heard the great Wind blare.</p></div> </div>
