Or to victorie.  

Now's the day, and now's the hour;  
See the front o' battle lower;  
See approach proud Edward's powerâ€”  
Chains and slaverie!  

Wha will be a traitor knave?  
Wha can fill a coward's grave?  
Wha sae base as be a slave?  
Let him turn and flee!  

Wha for Scotland's King and law  
Freedom's sword will strongly draw,  
Freeman stand, or freeman fa'?  
Let him follow me! </pre></div> </div>
