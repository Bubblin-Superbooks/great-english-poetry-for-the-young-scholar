The mist in _my_ face,  
When the snows begin, and the blasts denote  
I am nearing the place,  
The power of the night, the press of the storm,  
The post of the foe;  
Where he stands, the Arch Fear in a visible form,  
Yet the strong man must go:  
For the journey is done and the summit attained,  
And the barriers fall,  
Though a battle's to fight ere a guerdon be gained,  
The reward of it all.  
I was ever a fighter, so—one fight more.  
The best and the last!  
I would hate that death bandaged my eyes, and forebore, </pre></div> </div>
