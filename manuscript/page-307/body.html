Leave the deer, leave the steer,  
Leave nets and barges:  
Come with your fighting gear,  
Broadswords and targes.  

Come as the winds come, when  
Forests are rended;  
Come as the waves come, when  
Navies are stranded:  
Faster come, faster come,  
Faster and faster,  
Chief, vassal, page, and groom,  
Tenant and master.  

Fast they come, fast they come;  
See how they gather!  
Wide waves the eagle plume </pre></div> </div>
