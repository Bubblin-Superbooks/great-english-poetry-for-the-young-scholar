<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">
And now, far removed from the loved habitation,  
The tear of regret will intrusively swell.  
As fancy reverts to my father's plantation,  
And sighs for the bucket that hangs in the wellâ€”  
The old oaken bucket, the iron-bound bucket,  
The moss-covered bucket that hangs in the well!  </code></pre><p>-Samuel Woodworth.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
