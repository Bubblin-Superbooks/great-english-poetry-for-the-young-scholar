<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">white,<br>On sleeping wings they sail.<br>Ah, blessèd vision! blood of God!  
My spirit beats her mortal bars,<br>As down dark tides the glory slides,<br>And star-like mingles with the stars.</p><p>When on my goodly charger borne<br>Thro' dreaming towns I go,<br>The cock crows ere the Christmas morn,<br>The streets are dumb with snow.<br>The tempest crackles on the leads,<br>And, ringing, springs from brand and mail;<br>But o'er the dark a glory spreads,<br>And gilds the driving hail.<br>I leave the plain, I climb the height;<br>No branchy thicket shelter yields;<br>But blessèd forms in whistling storms<br>Fly o'er waste fens and windy fields.</p></div> </div>
