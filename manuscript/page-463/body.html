Evening and morn the Thirty  
Have turned the verses o'er,  
Traced from the right on linen white  
By mighty seers of yore.  

And with one voice the Thirty  
Have their glad answer given:  
"Go forth, go forth, Lars Porsena;  
Go forth, beloved of Heaven;  
Go, and return in glory  
To Clusium's royal dome;  
And hang round Nurscia's altars  
The golden shields of Rome."  

And now hath every city  
Sent up her tale of men;  
The foot are fourscore thousand, </pre></div> </div>
