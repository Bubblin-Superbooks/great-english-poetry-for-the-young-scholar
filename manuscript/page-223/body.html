The night is starry and cold, my friend,  
And the New-year blithe and bold, my friend,  
Comes up to take his own.  

How hard he breathes! over the snow  
I heard just now the crowing cock.  
The shadows flicker to and fro:  
The cricket chirps: the light burns low:  
'Tis nearly twelve o'clock.  
Shake hands, before you die.  
Old year, we'll dearly rue for you:  
What is it we can do for you?  
Speak out before you die.  

His face is growing sharp and thin.  
Alack! our friend is gone.  
Close up his eyes: tie up his chin: </pre></div> </div>
