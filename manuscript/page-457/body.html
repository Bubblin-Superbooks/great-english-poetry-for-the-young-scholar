<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="  "><code>The stately homes of England!  
How beautiful they stand,  
Amidst their tall ancestral trees,  
O'er all the pleasant land!  
The deer across their greensward bound  
Through shade and sunny gleam,  
And the swan glides past them with the sound  
Of some rejoicing stream.  

The merry homes of England!  
Around their hearths by night  
What gladsome looks of household love  
Meet in the ruddy light!  
There woman's voice flows forth in song,  
Or childish tale is told,  
Or lips move tunefully along  
Some glorious page of old. </pre></div> </div>
