So pass'd in making up the main account;  
All instincts immature,  
All purposes unsure,  
That weigh'd not as his work, yet swell'd the man's amount:  

Thoughts hardly to be pack'd  
Into a narrow act,  
Fancies that broke through language and escaped,  
All I could never be,  
All, men ignored in me,  
This, I was worth to God, whose wheel the pitcher shaped.  

Ay, note that Potter's wheel,  
That metaphor! and feel  
Why time spins fast, why passive lies our clay,â€” </pre></div> </div>
