Peeps the daisy white.  

Little hardy flowers,  
Like to children poor,  
Playing in their sturdy health  
By their mother's door,  
Purple with the north wind,  
Yet alert and bold;  
Fearing not, and caring not,  
Though they be a-cold!  

What to them is winter!  
What are stormy showers!  
Buttercups and daisies  
Are these human flowers!  
He who gave them hardships  
And a life of care, </pre></div> </div>
