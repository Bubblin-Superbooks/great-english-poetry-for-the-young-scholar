What a beautiful Pussy you are,—<br>You are,<br>What a beautiful Pussy you are!"</p><p>Pussy said to the Owl, "You elegant fowl!  
How wonderful sweet you sing!  
Oh, let us be married,—too long we have tarried,—<br>But what shall we do for a ring?"<br>They sailed away for a year and a day<br>To the land where the Bong-tree grows,<br>And there in a wood a piggy-wig stood<br>With a ring in the end of his nose,—<br>His nose,<br>With a ring in the end of his nose.<br>"Dear Pig, are you willing to sell for one shilling<br>Your ring?" Said the piggy, "I will,"<br>So they took it away, and were married next day</p></div> </div>
