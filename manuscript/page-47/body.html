<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">
Holdeth her cup;  
Rain is fast falling  
And filling it up.  

Little White Lily  
Said: "Good again,  
When I am thirsty  
To have the nice rain.  
Now I am stronger,  
Now I am cool;  
Heat cannot burn me,  
My veins are so full."  

Little White Lily  
Smells very sweet;  
On her head sunshine,  
Rain at her feet. </pre></div> </div>
