<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">
But I saw a glow-worm near,  
Who replied, "What wailing wight  
Calls the watchman of the night?  

"I am set to light the ground  
While the beetle goes his round.  
Follow now the beetle's humâ€”  
Little wanderer, hie thee home!"  </code></pre><p>-William Blake.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
