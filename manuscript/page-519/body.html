'Twas my forefather's hand  
That placed it near his cot;  
There, woodman, let it stand,  
Thy ax shall harm it not.  

That old familiar tree,  
Whose glory and renown  
Are spread o'er land and sea—  
And wouldst thou hew it down?  
Woodman, forbear thy stroke!  
Cut not its earth-bound ties;  
Oh, spare that agèd oak  
Now towering to the skies!  

When but an idle boy,  
I sought its grateful shade;  
In all their gushing joy </pre></div> </div>
