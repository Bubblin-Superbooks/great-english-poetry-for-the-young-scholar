The western tide crept up along the sand,  
And o'er and o'er the sand,  
And round and round the sand,  
As far as eye could see.  
The rolling mist came down and hid the land;  
And never home came she.  
Oh! is it weed, or fish, or floating hair,—  
A tress of golden hair,  
A drownèd maiden's hair,  
Above the nets at sea?  
Was never salmon yet that shone so fair  
Among the stakes on Dee.  

They rowed her in across the rolling foam,  
The cruel crawling foam,  
The cruel hungry foam, </pre></div> </div>
