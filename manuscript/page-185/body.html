Above our heads the sullen clouds  
Scud, black and swift, across the sky;  
Like silent ghosts in misty shrouds  
Stand out the white lighthouses high.  
Almost as far as eye can reach  
I see the close-reefed vessels fly,  
As fast we flit along the beach,  
One little sandpiper and I.  

I watch him as he skims along,  
Uttering his sweet and mournful cry;  
He starts not at my fitful song,  
Nor flash of fluttering drapery.  
He has no thought of any wrong,  
He scans me with a fearless eye;  
Stanch friends are we, well tried and strong, </pre></div> </div>
