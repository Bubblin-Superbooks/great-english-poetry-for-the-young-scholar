<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">
Together mixt, sweet recreation,  
And innocence, which most does please  
With meditation.  

Thus let me live, unseen, unknown;  
Thus unlamented let me die;  
Steal from the world, and not a stone  
Tell where I lie. </code></pre><p>-Alexander Pope.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
