Over the awful ocean  
Her signal guns pealed out.  
Dear God! was that Thy answer  
From the horror round about?  

A voice came down the wild wind,  
"Ho! ship ahoy!" its cry:  
"Our stout _Three Bells_ of Glasgow  
Shall stand till daylight by!"

Yet on the heaving swells  
Tossed up and down the ship-lights,  
The lights of the _Three Bells_!  

And ship to ship made signals, </pre></div> </div>
