Apple and peach tree fruited deep,  

Fair as the garden of the Lord  
To the eyes of the famished rebel horde,  

On that pleasant morn of the early fall  
When Lee marched over the mountain-wall,  

Over the mountains winding down,  
Horse and foot, into Frederick town.  

Forty flags with their silver stars,  
Forty flags with their crimson bars,  

Flapped in the morning wind: the sun  
Of noon looked down, and saw not one. </pre></div> </div>
