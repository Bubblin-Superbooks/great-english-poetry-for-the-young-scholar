And the lads are shaping bows;  

When the goodman mends his armour,  
And trims his helmet's plume;  
When the goodwife's shuttle merrily  
Goes flashing through the loom,â€”  
With weeping and with laughter  
Still is the story told,  
How well Horatius kept the bridge  
In the brave days of old. </code></pre><p>-Thomas B. Macaulay.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
