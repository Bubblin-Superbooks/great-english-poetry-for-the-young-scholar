The moss-covered bucket which hung in the well.  

That moss-covered vessel I hailed as a treasure,  
For often at noon, when returned from the field,  
I found it the source of an exquisite pleasure,  
The purest and sweetest that nature can yield.  
How ardent I seized it, with hands that were glowing,  
And quick to the white-pebbled bottom it fell;  
Then soon, with the emblem of truth overflowing,  
And dripping with coolness, it rose from the wellâ€”  
The old oaken bucket, the iron-bound bucket,  
The moss-covered bucket arose from the well.  

How sweet from the green mossy brim to receive it  
As poised on the curb it inclined to my lips!  
Not a full blushing goblet could tempt me to leave it,  
The brightest that beauty or revelry sips. </pre></div> </div>
