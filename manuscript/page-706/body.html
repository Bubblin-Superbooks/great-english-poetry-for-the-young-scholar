<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">
And that one talent which is death to hide,  
Lodg'd with me useless, though my soul more bent  
To serve therewith my Maker, and present  
My true account, lest He, returning, chide;  
Doth God exact day-labour, light denied?  
I fondly ask: but Patience, to prevent  
That murmur, soon replies, God doth not need  
Either man's work, or His own gifts; who best  
Bear His mild yoke, they serve Him best; His state  
Is kingly; thousands at His bidding speed,  
And post o'er land and ocean without rest;  
They also serve who only stand and wait.</code></pre><p>-John Milton.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
