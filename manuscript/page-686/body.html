Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."  

And the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting,  
On the pallid bust of Pallas, just above my chamber door;  
And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming,  
And the lamp-light o'er him streaming, throws his shadow on the floor;  
And my soul from out that shadow, that lies floating on the floor,  
Shall be liftedâ€”nevermore! </code></pre><p>-Edgar Allan Poe.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
