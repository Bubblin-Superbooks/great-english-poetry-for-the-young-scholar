A creature of heroic blood,  
A proud though childlike form.  

The flames rolled onâ€”he would not go  
Without his father's word;  
That father, faint in death below,  
His voice no longer heard.  

He called aloud, "Say, father, say  
If yet my task is done?"  
He knew not that the chieftain lay  
Unconscious of his son.  

"Speak, father!" once again he cried,  
"If I may yet be gone!"  
And but the booming shots replied,  
And fast the flames rolled on. </pre></div> </div>
