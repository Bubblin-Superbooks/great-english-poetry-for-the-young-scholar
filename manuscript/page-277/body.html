"Are ye wanting your key?"  
For she knows my queer ways, and my love for the shed  
(We've been forty years wed).

And I turns the old pages and has a good look  
For the text as I've found, as tells me as He  
Were the same trade as me.

But I think I'd as lief, with your leaves, let it go:  
It do seem that nice when I fall on it suddenâ€”  
Unexpected, you know!  </code></pre><p>-Catherine C. Liddell.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
