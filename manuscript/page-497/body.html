<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">
To load the May wind's restless wings,  
When, from the orchard row, he pours  
Its fragrance through our open doors;  
A world of blossoms for the bee,  
Flowers for the sick girl's silent room,  
For the glad infant sprigs of bloom,  
We plant with the apple-tree.  

What plant we in this apple-tree?  
Fruits that shall swell in sunny June,  
And redden in the August noon,  
And drop, when gentle airs come by,  
That fan the blue September sky,  
While children come, with cries of glee,  
And seek them where the fragrant grass  
Betrays their bed to those who pass,  
At the foot of the apple-tree. </pre></div> </div>
