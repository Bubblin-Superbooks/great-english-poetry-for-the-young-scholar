Instead of teaching you to sew!  
Pray, why did not your father make  
A saddler, sir, of you?"  

Each parasite, then, as in duty bound,  
The joke applauded, and the laugh went round.  
At length Modestus, bowing low,  
Said (craving pardon, if too free he made),  
"Sir, by your leave, I fain would know  
Your father's trade!"  

"My father's trade! by heaven, that's too bad!  
My father's trade? Why, blockhead, are you mad?  
My father, sir, did never stoop so lowâ€”  
He was a gentleman, I'd have you know."  

"Excuse the liberty I take," </pre></div> </div>
