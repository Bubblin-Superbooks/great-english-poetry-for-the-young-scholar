Bob-o'-link, bob-o'-link,  
Spink, spank, spink,  
Snug and safe is this nest of ours,  
Hidden among the summer flowers.  
Chee, chee, chee.  

Robert of Lincoln is gayly dressed,  
Wearing a bright, black wedding-coat;  
White are his shoulders, and white his crest,  
Hear him call in his merry note,  
Bob-o'-link, bob-o'-link,  
Spink, spank, spink,  
Look what a nice, new coat is mine;  
Sure there was never a bird so fine.  
Chee, chee, chee.  

Robert of Lincoln's Quaker wife, </pre></div> </div>
