### Cupid and My Campasbe.
</code></pre><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Cupid and my Campasbe played<br>At cards for kisses. Cupid paid.<br>He stakes his quiver, bow and arrows,<br>His mother's doves and team of sparrows.<br>Loses them, too; then down he throws<br>The coral of his lips, the rose<br>Growing on his cheek, but none knows how;<br>With them the crystal of his brow,<br>And then the dimple of his chin.<br>All these did my Campasbe</p></div> </div>
