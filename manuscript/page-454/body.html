My friends—do they now and then send  
A wish or a thought after me?  
Oh, tell me I yet have a friend,  
Though a friend I am never to see.  

How fleet is a glance of the mind!  
Compared with the speed of its flight,  
The tempest itself lags behind,  
And the swift-wingèd arrows of light.  
When I think of my own native land,  
In a moment I seem to be there;  
But alas! recollection at hand  
Soon hurries me back to despair.  

But the seafowl is gone to her nest,  
The beast is laid down in his lair, </pre></div> </div>
