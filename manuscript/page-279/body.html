And laugh'd and prattled in her world-wide bliss!  
But when we turn'd her sweet unlearned eye  
On our own isle, she rais'd a joyous cry,

And, while she hid all England with a kiss,  
Bright over Europe fell her golden hair!  </code></pre><p>-Charles Tennyson Turner.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
