<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">or day,  
I heave them whole to the conger or rip their plates away,  
First of the scattered legions, under a shrieking sky,  
Dipping between the rollers, the English Flag goes by.  

"The dead dumb fog hath wrapped it—the frozen dews have kissed—  
The naked stars have seen it, a fellow-star in the mist.  
What is the Flag of England? Ye have but my breath to dare,  
Ye have but my waves to conquer. Go forth, for it is there!"  </code></pre><p>-Rudyard Kipling.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
