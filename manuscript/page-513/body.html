What is home? A place where we experience independence, safety, privacy, and where we can dispense hospitality. "The family is the true unit."     )</p><pre class="  "><code>'Mid pleasures and palaces though we may roam,  
Be it ever so humble, there's no place like home;  
A charm from the sky seems to hallow us there,  
Which, seek through the world, is ne'er met with elsewhere.  
Home! Home! sweet, sweet Home!  
There's no place like Home! there's no place like Home! </pre></div> </div>
