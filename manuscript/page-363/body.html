He's but a coof for a' that;  
For a' that, and a' that,  
His riband, star, and a' that,  
The man of independent mind,  
He looks and laughs at a' that.  

A prince can make a belted knight,  
A marquis, duke, and a' that;  
But an honest man's aboon his might.  
Guid faith he maunna fa' that!  
For a' that, and a' that,  
Their dignities, and a' that,  
The pith o' sense, and pride o' worth,  
Are higher rank than a' that.  

Then let us pray that come it may—  
As come it will for a' that— </pre></div> </div>
