Thou, to whom fools propound,  
When the wine makes its round,  
"Since life fleets, all is change; the Past gone, seize to-day!"  

Fool! All that is, at all,  
Lasts ever, past recall;  
Earth changes, but thy soul and God stand sure;  
What enter'd into thee,  
_That_ was, is, and shall be:  
Time's wheel runs back or stops: Potter and clay endure.  

He fix'd thee 'mid this dance  
Of plastic circumstance,  
This Present, thou, forsooth, wouldst fain arrest  
Machinery just meant </pre></div> </div>
