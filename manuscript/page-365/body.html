If girls should be educated to be good mothers, so should boys be taught that fatherhood is the highest and holiest joy and right of man. The child is educator to the man. He teaches him how to take responsibility, how to give unbiased judgments, and how to be fatherly like "Our Father who is in Heaven."

The queerest little craft,  
Without an inch of rigging on;  
I looked and looked and laughed. </pre></div> </div>
