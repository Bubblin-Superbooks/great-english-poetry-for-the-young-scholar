The little sandpiper and I.  

Comrade, where wilt thou be to-night,  
When the loosed storm breaks furiously?  
My driftwood fire will burn so bright!  
To what warm shelter canst thou fly?  
I do not fear for thee, though wroth  
The tempest rushes through the sky;  
For are we not God's children both,  
Thou, little sandpiper, and I?  </code></pre><p>-Celia Thaxter.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
