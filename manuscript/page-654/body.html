That flow strew'd wrecks about the grass,  
That ebbe swept out the flocks to sea;  
A fatal ebbe and flow, alas!  
To manye more than myne and mee;  
But each will mourn his own (she saith);  
And sweeter woman ne'er drew breath  
Than my sonne's wife, Elizabeth.  

I shall never hear her more  
By the reedy Lindis shore,  
"Cusha! Cusha! Cusha!" calling,  
Ere the early dews be falling;  
I shall never hear her song,  
"Cusha! Cusha!" all along  
Where the sunny Lindis floweth,  
Goeth, floweth; </pre></div> </div>
