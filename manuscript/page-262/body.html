Volley'd and thunder'd;  
Storm'd at with shot and shell  
Boldly they rode and well,  
Into the jaws of Death,  
Into the mouth of Hell  
Rode the six hundred.  

Flash'd all their sabers bare,  
Flash'd as they turn'd in air  
Sab'ring the gunners there,  
Charging an army, while  
All the world wonder'd:  
Plunged in the battery-smoke  
Right thro' the line they broke;  
Cossack and Russian  
Reel'd from the saber-stroke  
Shatter'd and sunder'd. </pre></div> </div>
