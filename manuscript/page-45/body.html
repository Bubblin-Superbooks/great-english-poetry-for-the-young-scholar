It completely filled my heart, and has made every member of the lily family dear to me. George Macdonald's charming book, "At the Back of the North Wind," also was my wonder and delight.     )</p><pre class="  "><code>Little White Lily  
Sat by a stone,  
Drooping and waiting  
Till the sun shone.  
Little White Lily  
Sunshine has fed; </pre></div> </div>
