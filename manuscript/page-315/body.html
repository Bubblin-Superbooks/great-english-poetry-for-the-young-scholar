The heartless luxury of the tomb;  
But she remembers thee as one  
Long loved and for a season gone;  
For thee her poet's lyre is wreathed,  
Her marble wrought, her music breathed;  
For thee she rings the birthday bells;  
Of thee her babe's first lisping tells;  
For thine her evening prayer is said  
At palace-couch and cottage-bed;  
Her soldier, closing with the foe,  
Gives for thy sake a deadlier blow,  
His plighted maiden, when she fears  
For him the joy of her young years,  
Thinks of thy fate, and checks her tears;  
And she, the mother of thy boys,  
Though in her eye and faded cheek  
Is read the grief she will not speak, </pre></div> </div>
