Here, too, my sisters played.  
My mother kissed me here;  
My father pressed my handâ€”  
Forgive this foolish tear,  
But let that old oak stand.  

My heart-strings round thee cling,  
Close as thy bark, old friend!  
Here shall the wild-bird sing,  
And still thy branches bend.  
Old tree! the storm still brave!  
And, woodman, leave the spot;  
While I've a hand to save,  
Thy ax shall harm it not.  </code></pre><p>-George Pope Morris.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
