Up rose old Barbara Frietchie then,  
Bowed with her fourscore years and ten,  

Bravest of all in Frederick town,  
She took up the flag the men hauled down.  

In her attic window the staff she set,  
To show that one heart was loyal yet.  

Up the street came the rebel tread,  
Stonewall Jackson riding ahead.  

Under his slouched hat left and right  
He glanced: the old flag met his sight.  

"Halt!"â€”the dust-brown ranks stood fast. </pre></div> </div>
