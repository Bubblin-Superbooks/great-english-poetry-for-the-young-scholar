Over Egypt's sands, over Alpine snows,  
At the pyramids, at the mountain,  
Where the wave of the lordly Danube flows,  
And by the Italian fountain,  

On the snowy cliffs where mountain streams  
Dash by the Switzer's dwelling,  
He led again, in his dying dreams,  
His hosts, the proud earth quelling.  

Again Marengo's field was won,  
And Jena's bloody battle;  
Again the world was overrun,  
Made pale at his cannon's rattle.  

He died at the close of that darksome day, </pre></div> </div>
