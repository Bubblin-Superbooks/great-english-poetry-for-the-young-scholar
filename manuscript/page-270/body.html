In the air  
Like a ghost in a chair,  
Always looking what I am aboutâ€”  
I hate to be watched; I'll blow you out."  

The Wind blew hard, and out went the Moon.  
So, deep  
On a heap  
Of clouds to sleep,  
Down lay the Wind, and slumbered soon,  
Muttering low, "I've done for that Moon."  

He turned in his bed; she was there again!  
On high  
In the sky,  
With her one ghost eye,  
The Moon shone white and alive and plain. </pre></div> </div>
