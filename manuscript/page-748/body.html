Who walk on the turf that lies over their brow,  
Who make in their dwellings a transient abode,  
Meet the changes they met on their pilgrimage road.  

Yea! hope and despondence, and pleasure and pain,  
Are mingled together like sunshine and rain;  
And the smile and the tear, and the song and the dirge,  
Still follow each other, like surge upon surge.  

'Tis the wink of an eye, 'tis the draught of a breath,  
From the blossom of health to the paleness of death,  
From the gilded saloon to the bier and the shroud,â€”  
O why should the spirit of mortal be proud?  </code></pre><p>-William Knox.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
