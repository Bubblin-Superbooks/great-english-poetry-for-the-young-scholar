### Fairy Song.
</code></pre><p>Shed no tear! O shed no tear!  
The flower will bloom another year.<br>Weep no more! O, weep no more!  
Young buds sleep in the root's white core.<br>Dry your eyes! Oh! dry your eyes!  
For I was taught in Paradise<br>To ease my breast of melodies—<br>Shed no tear.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Overhead! look overhead!  
'Mong the blossoms white and red—<br>Look up, look up. I flutter now<br>On this flush pomegranate</p></div> </div>
