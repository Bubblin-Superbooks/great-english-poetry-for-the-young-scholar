<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="  "><code>Come, dear children, let us away;  
Down and away below!  
Now my brothers call from the bay,  
Now the great winds shoreward blow,  
Now the salt tides seaward flow;  
Now the wild white horses play,  
Champ and chafe and toss in the spray.  
Children dear, let us away!  
This way, this way!  

Call her once before you go—  
Call once yet!  
In a voice that she will know:  
"Margaret! Margaret!"  
Children's voices should be dear  
(Call once more to a mother's ear;   ) 

Children's voices, wild with pain— </pre></div> </div>
