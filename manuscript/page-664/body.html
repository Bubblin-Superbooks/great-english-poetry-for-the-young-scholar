And those who were good shall be happy: they shall sit in a golden chair;  
They shall splash at a ten-league canvas with brushes of comet's hair;  
They shall find real saints to draw fromâ€”Magdalene, Peter, and Paul;  
They shall work for an age at a sitting and never be tired at all!  

And only the Master shall praise us, and only the Master shall blame;  
And no one shall work for money, and no one shall work for fame;  
But each for the joy of the working, and each, in his separate star,  
Shall draw the Thing as he sees It for the God of Things</pre></div> </div>
