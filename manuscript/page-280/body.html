O'er my angel-guarded bed,  
That an emmet lost its way  
When on grass methought I lay.  

Troubled, 'wildered, and forlorn,  
Dark, benighted, travel-worn,  
Over many a tangled spray,

Do they hear their father sigh?  
Now they look abroad to see.  
Now return and weep for me."  

Pitying, I dropped a tear; </pre></div> </div>
