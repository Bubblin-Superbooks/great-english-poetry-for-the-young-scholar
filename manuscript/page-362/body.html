For a' that, and a' that,  
Our toils obscure, and a' that;  
The rank is but the guinea's stamp,  
The man's the gowd for a' that!  

What though on hamely fare we dine,  
Wear hoddin-gray, and a' that;  
Gie fools their silks, and knaves their wine,  
A man's a man for a' that!  
For a' that, and a' that,  
Their tinsel show, and a' that;  
The honest man, though e'er sae poor,  
Is king o' men for a' that!  

Ye see yon birkie ca'd a lord,  
Wha struts, and stares, and a' that;  
Though hundreds worship at his word, </pre></div> </div>
