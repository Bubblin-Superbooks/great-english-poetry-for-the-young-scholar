And truly 'twas a gallant thing to see that crowning show,  
Valour, and love, and a king above, and the royal beasts below.  

Ramp'd and roar'd the lions, with horrid laughing jaws;  
They bit, they glared, gave blows like beams, a wind went with their paws;  
With wallowing might and stifled roar they rolled on one another,  
Till all the pit with sand and mane was in a thunderous smother;  
The bloody foam above the bars came whisking through the air;  
Said Francis then, "Faith, gentlemen, we're better here than there." </pre></div> </div>
