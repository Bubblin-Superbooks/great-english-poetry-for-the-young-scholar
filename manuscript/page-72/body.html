No lark could pipe to skies so dull and gray;  
Yet, ere we part, one lesson I can leave you  
For every day.  

Be good, sweet maid, and let who will be clever;  
Do noble things, not dream them all day long:  
And so make life, death, and that vast forever  
One grand, sweet song.  </code></pre><p>-Charles Kingsley.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
