Till I scarcely more than muttered—"Other friends have flown before,  
On the morrow he will leave me, as my hopes have flown before."  
Then the bird said, "Nevermore."  

Startled by the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,  
"Doubtless," said I, "what it utters is its only stock and store,  
Caught from some unhappy master, whom unmerciful disaster  
Followed fast and followed faster, till his songs one burden bore—  
Till the dirges of his hope this melancholy burden bore—  
Of 'Never, nevermore,'" </pre></div> </div>
