Some thousand years ago,  
Whose slender hands were nothing worth,  
Whether to plow, or reap, or sow.  

Upon an empty tortoise-shell  
He stretched some chords, and drew  
Music that made men's bosoms swell  
Fearless, or brimmed their eyes with dew.

Pure taste by right divine,  
Decreed his singing not too bad  
To hear between the cups of wine:  

And so, well pleased with being soothed  
Into a sweet half-sleep, </pre></div> </div>
