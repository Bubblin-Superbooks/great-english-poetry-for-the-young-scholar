A rare old plant is the ivy green.  

Whole ages have fled, and their works decayed,  
And nations have scattered been;  
But the stout old ivy shall never fade  
From its hale and hearty green.  
The brave old plant in its lonely days  
Shall fatten upon the past;  
For the stateliest building man can raise  
Is the ivy's food at last.  
Creeping where no life is seen,  
A rare old plant is the ivy green.  </code></pre><p>-Charles Dickens.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
