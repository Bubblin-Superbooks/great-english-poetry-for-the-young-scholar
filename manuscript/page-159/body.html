In bulk doth make man better be;  
Or standing long an oak, three hundred year  
To fall a log at last, dry, bald, and sear  
A lily of a day  
Is fairer far in May,  
Although it fall and die that night,â€”  
It was the plant and flower of light.  
In small proportions we just beauties see; </pre></div> </div>
