Matched with thine, would be all  
But an empty vauntâ€”  
A thing wherein we feel there is some hidden want.  

What objects are the fountains  
Of thy happy strain?  
What fields, or waves, or mountains?  
What shapes of sky or plain?  
What love of thine own kind? what ignorance of pain?  

Teach me half the gladness  
That thy brain must know,  
Such harmonious madness  
From my lips would flow,  
The world should listen then, as I am listening now!  </code></pre><p>-Percy Bysshe Shelley.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
