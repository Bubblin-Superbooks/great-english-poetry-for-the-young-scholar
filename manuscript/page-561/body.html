A year when nations ventured against us to combine,  
_Quebec_ was burned and Farmer slain, by us remembered not;  
But thanks be to the French book wherein they're not forgot.  

Now you, if you've to fight the French, my youngster, bear in mind  
Those seamen of King Louis so chivalrous and kind;  
Think of the Breton gentlemen who took our lads to Brest,  
And treat some rescued Breton as a comrade and a guest.</code></pre><hr class="section"></div> </div>
