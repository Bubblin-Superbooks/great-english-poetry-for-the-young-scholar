### A Happy Life.
</code></pre><p>How happy is he born and taught<br>That serveth not another's will;<br>Whose armour is his honest thought,<br>And simple truth his utmost skill!</p><p>Whose passions not his master's are,<br>Whose soul is still prepared for death,<br>Not tied unto the world with care<br>Of public fame, or private breath.</p><pre class="  "><code>
