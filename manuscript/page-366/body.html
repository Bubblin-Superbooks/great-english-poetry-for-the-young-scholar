It seemed so curious that she  
Should cross the Unknown water,  
And moor herself right in my room,  
My daughter, O my daughter!  

Yet by these presents witness all  
She's welcome fifty times,  
And comes consigned to Hope and Love  
And common-meter rhymes.  
She has no manifest but this,  
No flag floats o'er the water,  
She's too new for the British Lloydsâ€”  
My daughter, O my daughter!  

Ring out, wild bells, and tame ones too!  
Ring out the lover's moon!  
Ring in the little worsted socks! </pre></div> </div>
