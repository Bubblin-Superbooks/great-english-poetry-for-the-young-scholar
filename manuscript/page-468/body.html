Rise fast along the sky.  

And nearer, fast, and nearer  
Doth the red whirlwind come;  
And louder still, and still more loud,  
From underneath that rolling cloud,  
Is heard the trumpet's war-note proud,  
The trampling and the hum.  
And plainly and more plainly  
Now through the gloom appears,  
Far to left and far to right,  
In broken gleams of dark-blue light,  
The long array of helmets bright,  
The long array of spears.  

And plainly and more plainly,  
Above the glimmering line, </pre></div> </div>
