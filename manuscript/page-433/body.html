And Appenzel's stout infantry, and Egmont's Flemish spears.  
There rode the brood of false Lorraine, the curses of our land;  
And dark Mayenne was in the midst, a truncheon in his hand;  
And, as we looked on them, we thought of Seine's empurpled flood,  
And good Coligni's hoary hair all dabbled with his blood;  
And we cried unto the living God, who rules the fate of war,  
To fight for His own holy name, and Henry of Navarre.  

The King is come to marshal us, in all his armour drest,  
And he has bound a snow-white plume upon his gallant crest. </pre></div> </div>
