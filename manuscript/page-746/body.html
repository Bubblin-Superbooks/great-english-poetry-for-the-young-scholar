The peasant whose lot was to sow and to reap,  
The herdsman who climbed with his goats to the steep,  
The beggar that wandered in search of his bread,  
Have faded away like the grass that we tread.  

The saint that enjoyed the communion of heaven,  
The sinner that dared to remain unforgiven,  
The wise and the foolish, the guilty and just,  
Have quietly mingled their bones in the dust.  

So the multitude goes, like the flower and the weed  
That wither away to let others succeed;  
So the multitude comes, even those we behold,  
To repeat every tale that hath often been told.  

For we are the same that our fathers have been; </pre></div> </div>
