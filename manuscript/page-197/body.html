Till a gateway she discerns  
With armorial bearings stately,  
And beneath the gate she turns;  
Sees a mansion more majestic  
Than all those she saw before;  
Many a gallant gay domestic  
Bows before him at the door.  

And they speak in gentle murmur  
When they answer to his call,  
While he treads with footstep firmer,  
Leading on from hall to hall.  

And while now she wanders blindly,  
Nor the meaning can divine,  
Proudly turns he round and kindly,  
"All of this is mine and thine." </pre></div> </div>
