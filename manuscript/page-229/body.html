The whinnying mare her master knows,  
When into the yard the farmer goes,  
His cattle calling,—  
"Co', boss! co', boss! co'! co'! co'!"  
While still the cow-boy, far away,  
Goes seeking those that have gone astray,—  
"Co', boss! co', boss! co'! co'!"  

Now to her task the milkmaid goes.  
The cattle come crowding through the gate,  
Lowing, pushing, little and great;  
About the trough, by the farm-yard pump,  
The frolicsome yearlings frisk and jump,  
While the pleasant dews are falling;—  
The new-milch heifer is quick and shy,  
But the old cow waits with tranquil eye;  
And the white stream into the bright pail flows, </pre></div> </div>
