So there it lay, through wet and dry,  
As empty as the last new sonnet,  
Till by and by came Mercury,  
And, having mused upon it,  
"Why, here," cried he, "the thing of things  
In shape, material, and dimension!  
Give it but strings, and, lo, it sings,  
A wonderful invention!"  

So said, so done; the chords he strained,  
And, as his fingers o'er them hovered,  
The shell disdained a soul had gained,  
The lyre had been discovered.  
O empty world that round us lies,  
Dead shell, of soul and thought forsaken,  
Brought we but eyes like Mercury's, </pre></div> </div>
