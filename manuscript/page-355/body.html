There woman's voice flows forth in song,<br>Or childish tale is told,<br>Or lips move tunefully along<br>Some glorious page of old.</p><p>The bless√®d homes of England!  
How softly on their bowers<br>Is laid the holy quietness<br>That breathes from Sabbath hours!  
Solemn, yet sweet, the church-bell's chime<br>Floats through their woods at morn;<br>All other sounds, in that still time,<br>Of breeze and leaf are born.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">The cottage homes of England!  
By thousands on her plains,<br>They are smiling o'er the silvery brooks,<br>And round the hamlets'</p></div> </div>
