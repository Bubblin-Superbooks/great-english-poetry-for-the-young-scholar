When she proffers thee her chalice,—  
Wine and spices mixed with malice,—  
When she smites thee with her staff  
To transform thee, do thou laugh!  
Safe thou art if thou but bear  
The least leaf of moly rare.  
Close it grows beside her portal,  
Springing from a stock immortal,  
Yes! and often has the Witch  
Sought to tear it from its niche;  
But to thwart her cruel will  
The wise God renews it still.  
Though it grows in soil perverse,  
Heaven hath been its jealous nurse,  
And a flower of snowy mark  
Springs from root and sheathing dark;  
Kingly safeguard, only herb </pre></div> </div>
