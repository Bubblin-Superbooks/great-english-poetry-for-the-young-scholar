Her rattling shrouds all sheathed in ice,  
With the masts went by the board;  
Like a vessel of glass she stove and sank,â€”  
Ho! ho! the breakers roared!  

At daybreak on the bleak sea-beach  
A fisherman stood aghast,  
To see the form of a maiden fair  
Lashed close to a drifting mast.  

The salt sea was frozen on her breast,  
The salt tears in her eyes;  
And he saw her hair, like the brown sea-weed,  
On the billows fall and rise.  

Such was the wreck of the _Hesperus_, </pre></div> </div>
