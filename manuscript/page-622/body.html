And gather up its fruit of tears.  

The stars come nightly to the sky;  
The tidal wave comes to the sea;  
Nor time, nor space, nor deep, nor high,  
Can keep my own away from me.  

The waters know their own and draw  
The brook that springs in yonder heights;  
So flows the good with equal law  
Unto the soul of pure delights.</code></pre><p>-John Burroughs.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
