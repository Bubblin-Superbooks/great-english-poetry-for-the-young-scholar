Shone over it with a warm good-night.  

Barbara Frietchie's work is o'er,  
And the rebel rides on his raids no more.  

Honour to her! and let a tear  
Fall, for her sake, on Stonewall's bier.  

Over Barbara Frietchie's grave,  
Flag of Freedom and Union, wave!  

Peace and order and beauty draw  
Round thy symbol of light and law;  

And ever the stars above look down  
On thy stars below in Frederick town!</code></pre><p>-John G. Whittier.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
