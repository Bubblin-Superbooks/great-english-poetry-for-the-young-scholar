Upon a thanklesse arrant;  
Feare not to touche the best—  
The truth shall be thy warrant!  
Goe, since I needs must dye,  
And give the world the lye.  

Goe tell the court it glowes  
And shines like rotten wood;  
Goe tell the church it showes  
What's good, and doth no good;  
If church and court reply,  
Then give them both the lye.  

Tell potentates they live  
Acting by others' actions—  
Not loved unlesse they give, </pre></div> </div>
