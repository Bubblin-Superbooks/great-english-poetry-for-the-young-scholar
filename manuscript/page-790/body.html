<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">reckon'd the earth much?  
Have you practised so long to learn to read?  
Have you felt so proud to get at the meaning of poems?  

Stop this day and night with me and you shall possess the origin of all poems,  
You shall possess the good of the earth and sun (there are millions of suns left),  
You shall no longer take things at second or third hand, nor look through the eyes of the dead, nor feed on the specters in books,  
You shall not look through my eyes either, nor take things from me,  
You shall listen to all sides and filter them from yourself.  

A child said, "_What is the grass?_" fetching it to me with full hands; </pre></div> </div>
