Here he lives in state and bounty,  
Lord of Burleigh, fair and free.  
Not a lord in all the county  
Is so great a lord as he.  
All at once the colour flushes  
Her sweet face from brow to chin;  
As it were with same she blushes,  
And her spirit changed within.  

Then her countenance all over  
Pale again as death did prove:  
But he clasp'd her like a lover,  
And he cheer'd her soul with love.  

So she strove against her weakness,  
Tho' at times her spirits sank; </pre></div> </div>
