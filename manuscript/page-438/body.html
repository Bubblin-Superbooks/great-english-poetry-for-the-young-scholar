Ho! Philip, send, for charity, thy Mexican pistoles,  
That Antwerp monks may sing a mass for thy poor spearman's souls.  
Ho! gallant nobles of the League, look that your arms be bright;  
Ho! burghers of Saint Genevieve, keep watch and ward to-night.  
For our God hath crushed the tyrant, our God hath raised the slave,  
And mocked the counsel of the wise, the valour of the brave.  
Then glory to His holy name, from whom all glories are;  
And glory to our Sovereign Lord, King Henry of Navarre.  </code></pre><p>-Thomas B. Macaulay.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
