<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>"This is the way," laugh'd the great god Pan<br>(Laugh'd while he sat by the river),<br>"The only way, since gods began<br>To make sweet music, they could succeed."<br>Then, dropping his mouth to a hole in the reed<br>He blew in power by the river.</p><p>Sweet, sweet, sweet, O Pan!  
Piercing sweet by the river!  
Blinding sweet, O great god Pan!  
The sun on the hill forgot to die,<br>And the lilies reviv'd, and the dragon-fly<br>Came back to dream on the river.</p><p>Yet half a beast is the great god Pan,<br>To laugh as he sits by the river,<br>Making a poet out of a man:<br>The true gods sigh for the cost and pain,â€”<br>For the reed which grows nevermore again<br>As a reed with the reeds in the river.</p></div> </div>
