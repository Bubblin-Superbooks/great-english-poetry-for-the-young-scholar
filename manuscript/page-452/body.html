My right there is none to dispute,  
From the center all round to the sea,  
I am lord of the fowl and the brute.  
O Solitude! where are the charms  
That sages have seen in thy face?  
Better dwell in the midst of alarms  
Than reign in this horrible place.  

I am out of humanity's reach,  
I must finish my journey alone,  
Never hear the sweet music of speech,â€”  
I start at the sound of my own.  
The beasts that roam over the plain </pre></div> </div>
