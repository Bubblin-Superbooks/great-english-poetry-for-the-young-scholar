Then they rode back, but not  
Not the six hundred.  

Cannon to right of them,  
Cannon to left of them,  
Cannon behind them  
Volleyed and thundered:  
Stormed at with shot and shell,  
While horse and hero fell,  
They that had fought so well  
Came through the jaws of death  
Back from the mouth of hell,  
All that was left of themâ€”  
Left of six hundred.  

When can their glory fade?  
Oh, the wild charge they made! </pre></div> </div>
