It needs a great deal of explanation, and few boys will hold out to the end in learning it. But "it pays." (1865-.)</p><pre class="  "><code>It was our war-ship _Clampherdown_  
Would sweep the Channel clean,  
Wherefore she kept her hatches close  
When the merry Channel chops arose,  
To save the bleached marine. </pre></div> </div>
